"""Cut data/local/map.png -- the web map's base image -- out of the installed game.

    uv run --extra gen python tools/gen_map_image.py

A rendered map of this world is Coffee Stain's artwork, so ``/api/mapimage`` is a loader
and only a loader: this reads the player's own install into gitignored ``data/local/``,
and none of it is ever committed or served past localhost.

The in-game world map is four ``Texture2D`` under
``/Game/FactoryGame/Interface/UI/Assets/MapTest/SlicedMap/Map_{col}-{row}``, each 4096x4096
``PF_DXT1`` with 13 mips, stitching into one 8192x8192 sheet. Both readings of that name
produce a plausible map -- the world is roughly symmetric at a glance -- so ``seam_residuals``
re-proves the layout every run and the run refuses to write if it stops holding. That the
sheet spans the corners the sidecar pins is likewise re-measured, by ``calibrate``.

The sheet is also cut into ``data/local/tiles/{z}/{x}_{y}.png``, one resolution per zoom, so
that the page fetches a few hundred KB at the whole-world framing instead of 16.2 MB that
decodes to 268 MB of RGBA. ``map.png`` stays as the fallback for a page that finds no
pyramid and the one file a reader can open and eyeball. ``tiles@2x/`` is the same grid at
twice the density for a display whose device pixel ratio is above one, one level shallower
by arithmetic, and a client past its top asks for the 1x tile again; ``--no-tiles-2x`` skips
it. Each tree is staged and renamed into place separately, so no pair is ever half-swapped.

``--enhance`` adds z6 and z7 -- two more zoom levels than the artwork has pixels, since
8192 px is about 0.9 m to the pixel and a factory is machines eight metres across -- by
running the sheet through Real-ESRGAN 4x on the GPU. Off by default: it needs a 45 MB
binary this repository will not vendor and a Vulkan device.

    uv run --extra gen python tools/gen_map_image.py --enhance

The stage is four passes and the model is only the second; ``presharpen``, ``faint_mask``
and ``colour_fix`` are the other three, and each says at its own definition what it repairs.
Everything it claims is re-measured per run into ``_meta.tiles.enhancement``: the tile seams
against boundaries that are not seams, and the low levels against the enhanced pixels they
did not come from. A run whose recipe is behind the one the sidecar names refuses rather
than quietly halving the map's resolution; ``--force`` says it anyway.

The stage needs ``numpy`` and ``scipy``, which are outright dependencies of this project, so
both halves of it provably run against one numpy.
