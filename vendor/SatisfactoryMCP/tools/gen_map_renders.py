"""Draw two base-map layers of this world out of the 1 m heightfield and the game's biomes.

    uv run --extra gen python tools/gen_map_renders.py

``tools/gen_map_image.py`` cuts the game's own drawn map into ``data/local/tiles/``; this
file adds two layers drawn rather than found. **terrain** is a hypsometric ramp under a
north-west hillshade with water tinted by its own depth; **satellite** is the same relief
coloured from the game's own per-pixel biome raster through a palette designed to look like
imagery. Both are 32768x32768 on the **same frame as the artwork sheet** -- x [-3247, 4253]
m, y [-3750, 3750] m -- and cut into the same 256 px pyramid, so the page's tile grid, CRS
and bounds are untouched and a layer is a change of picture and nothing else.

The height under a pixel comes from two regimes and a cross-fade between them. Where
``density.u8.z`` says at least one source vertex landed in the ground under an output texel,
the cliff geometry is rasterised into this grid at 0.229 m -- by ``gen_world_heightmap.py``'s
own sweep, mesh decode, cull rules and ``MaxZRaster``, imported and called here so the only
thing that differs is the grid they are pointed at. Everywhere else, which is the great
majority of the sheet, a Catmull-Rom kernel over the 1 m field answers. The join is a blend
and never a switch: the hillshade is a function of the derivative, so a hard switch between
a rasterised surface and a C1 interpolant would draw the density plane's own boundaries into
the relief as ridges. ``SeamTrace`` measures that along the seam on every run.

The frame and the artwork slices come from ``tools/gen_map_image.py``, which measured them;
the codec from ``domain.spatial.heightfield``, the pyramid cutter from
``core.gameassets.pyramid``, and the biome decode from ``core.gameassets.maparea``, which
``tools/gen_region_names.py`` reads too. Nothing about any of them is re-decided here,
because three pyramids that retype each other's corners are three pyramids that disagree
about where the world is.

Everything is written under gitignored ``data/local/renders/<layer>/``:
``tiles/{z}/{x}_{y}.png`` for z0..z7, ``tiles@2x/{z}/{x}_{y}.png`` for z0..z5, and a
``meta.json`` the web API reads. Four pins are refused on rather than overwritten -- a field
whose sidecar names another build, a field that is not there, a field with no density plane,
and a direct cache rasterised for another size or build. ``ooz``, ``texture2ddecoder`` and
Pillow are the project's ``gen`` extra and are imported inside the functions that need them,
so a machine without the extra still imports every module and runs the test suite.

The heightfield and the biome raster are derived from Coffee Stain's cooked assets, read out
of the reader's own install. The colours are this file's, and nothing here is committed,
uploaded or redistributed.

#: render drawn from the field alone is smooth because it has nothing to say. Landscape is
#: absent because it is continuous geometry the game evaluates itself, 45.3% of the field.
#:
#: **Both cliff values**, spelled through ``PROV_CLIFF_VALUES`` so a third one cannot be
#: added without this line seeing it. 73% of the shipped field's cliff province is 5, so
#: listing only 4 would withdraw the borrow from three quarters of it.
BORROW_PROVENANCE = (*hf.PROV_CLIFF_VALUES, hf.PROV_FILL)

#: How far the borrow fades out across a province boundary, in field texels (metres). The

#: would draw the label itself: a coastline of shading style around every island.
BORROW_FEATHER_M = 6.0

#: The scale of artwork detail that is borrowed, in artwork pixels (0.92 m each). The high
#: pass is the sheet minus its own Gaussian blur at this sigma, so what comes across is
#: everything FINER than about 7 m and nothing coarser: the coarse structure is the field's
#: job and the two must not both draw it.
BORROW_DETAIL_SIGMA_PX = 8.0

#: What separates borrowing the artwork's SHADING from tracing its ink. The map is a drawing
#: and a drawing has strokes -- every rock formation is outlined in a hard dark line one or
#: two pixels wide -- so the high pass is first blurred, which turns a stroke into the
#: gradient it stands in for, and then squashed through ``tanh`` at this many standard
#: deviations of itself. A soft clip passes the mid-tones, which are the shading, almost
#: linearly and saturates the outliers, which are the ink.
BORROW_DETAIL_SOFTEN_PX = 1.6

# The direct regime: which output texels are entitled to the triangles, and how the two
# regimes are joined.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: How many source vertices the ground under one OUTPUT texel has to have contributed before
#: that texel's height is a measurement rather than an interpolation across a triangle wider
#: than itself. The rule is the field generator's, imported rather than retyped; this file
#: only evaluates it at a different spacing. ``density.u8.z`` counts per 1 m texel, so the
#: test against a 0.229 m texel is ``density >= 1 / 0.229**2``, i.e. 19 of them.
DIRECT_SAMPLES_PER_TEXEL = gen.DIRECT_SAMPLES_MIN

#: How many sub-samples per output texel per axis the direct pass rasterises at. The pass
#: costs 4x per doubling and the silhouette it antialiases is already at 0.229 m, an eighth
#: of the 1 m staircase this regime exists to remove; ``COVERAGE_TENT`` below reconstructs
#: the same fractional edge from the binary mask for two separable 3-taps. Raise it with
#: ``--direct-subsamples`` and the sidecar records what was run.
DIRECT_SUBSAMPLES = 1

#: The tent the direct raster's own coverage is reconstructed with: the antialiasing on the
#: direct silhouettes. A 3-tap 1-2-1 in each axis over the binary coverage turns a hard
#: per-texel in/out decision into a fraction over one texel, and the heights go through the
#: same kernel WEIGHTED BY THAT COVERAGE, so a texel just outside the rock is a fraction of
#: the rock's own edge height rather than a fraction of zero. Off with
#: ``--direct-subsamples`` above 1, where the supersample has already done it.
COVERAGE_TENT = np.array([0.25, 0.5, 0.25], np.float32)

#: The knee of the smoothed positive part that lets a rock raise the ground and never lower
#: it, in metres: the field's own hard ``max`` with its corner rounded. A hard max puts a
#: first-derivative discontinuity where the rock meets the ground, and the hillshade would
#: draw it as a line around the base of every formation on the map. A quarter of a metre
#: sits at most an eighth of one above the hard answer and never below it, so the rule holds
#: exactly rather than nearly.
DIRECT_LIFT_KNEE_M = 0.25


#: Rows of the output the direct pass rasterises at a time. A whole 32768 square of float32
#: is 4.3 GB and the render already holds 3.2 GB of output; 256 rows is 34 MB, and a
#: triangle at the 0.48 m median touches one band or two, so a per-placement y-bbox test is
#: all the selection needed. Also the colour bands' size and one row of 256 px tiles.
DIRECT_BAND_ROWS = 256

#: Where the direct raster is kept between the two layers. Rasterising 216 M triangles is
#: twenty minutes and the answer does not depend on which layer is being coloured, so it is
#: done once, memory-mapped, and deleted at the end of the run unless ``--keep-direct``.

#: curvature the surface does not have and the run says so.
#:
#: "At the seam" is the whole BLEND rather than a window around the half-weight line. A
#: feather's second derivative is zero at its own midpoint by symmetry -- it lives at the
#: shoulders -- so a window around ``w = 0.5`` measures the one place a hard join has
#: nothing to show, and a nearly-hard join sails through it. Every 3-texel stencil is

SEAM_SAMPLE_MAX_PER_BAND = 200_000

    A trace rather than probes: probes are sparse relative to a seam, and a ridge one texel
    wide along a density contour is invisible to all of them. What is measured is
    ``|d2z/dx2|`` along every row of every band over the whole square, with each 3-texel
    stencil sorted by the weights under all three of its texels.

    **Read the ratios against the switch, not against the pure regimes.** This file
    composites a rock onto a lattice by the rock's own coverage, so the join IS the rock's
    silhouette -- a real cliff edge, where enormous curvature is the correct answer, and the
    pure-regime ratio reads 138 on the shipped render with every bit of that terrain.
    Restricting the comparison to where the two surfaces agree only moves the join to the
    rock's base, which is also real. The hard ``max`` over the same texels is the one
    reference that is not the terrain, and it is not a gate either: a convex blend cannot be
    rougher than the switch between its own extreme points, so the number says how much of
    that ceiling the fade spends (0.5 on the shipped render).

    The smoothness itself is guaranteed by the arithmetic rather than by this statistic:
    ``blend_regimes`` is a convex combination in a coverage the tent reconstructs
