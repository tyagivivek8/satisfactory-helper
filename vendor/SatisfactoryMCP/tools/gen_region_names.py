"""Generate data/region_names.json -- the ADVISORY region-name layer, from the game's areas.

    uv run --extra gen python tools/gen_region_names.py

This is layer 2 of the spatial design. Layer 1 (grid cells, cones, radii, clustering) is exact
and derived, and every calculation uses it. This layer only puts human names on coordinates,
and a name must never feed a computation.

The geometry is the game's own. ``FGMapAreaTexture`` is a 4096x4096 raster of palette indices
at 1.83 m to the texel, and ``mColorToArea`` resolves each index to a ``UFGMapArea`` carrying
the game's display name for the place; ``core.gameassets.maparea`` reads it, and
``tools/gen_map_renders.py`` reads the same asset. Two grids come out: the 30x30 at 256 m
``/api/regions`` serves, and a 120x120 at 64 m ``domain.spatial.regions`` looks names up in,
each with a confidence grid of its own shape. The emitted ``_meta`` carries the rest -- the
naming rules, the measurement that chose 64 m, the licence, and the record of the retired
wiki trace.
