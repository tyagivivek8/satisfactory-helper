"""Cut a real 1 m heightmap of this world out of the installed game.

    uv run --extra gen python tools/gen_world_heightmap.py

Five stages fuse into one field: the cooked UE Landscape heightfield (a
``LandscapeComponent``'s ``GrassData`` blob opens with 128x128 uint16 height samples, one
per 1 m quad), the rock meshes' own cooked geometry rasterised as a max-Z overlay, the
2048 px ``HeightData_Test`` interface raster as fill outside the landscape frame, and the
game's own water actors for where the water is and how high it stands. The landscape is the
sculpted terrain and nothing else -- every cliff, mesa and boulder is a placed static mesh
-- so the overlay is what makes the tail of the error distribution bearable, and the run
proves that per build by sampling the finished field at every static resource node and
refusing to write if the trimmed RMS misses ``VALIDATION_TRIM_RMS_MAX_M``.

It writes ``data/local/heightmap/``, six files, about 18 MB::

    height.i16.z  7500x7500 int16 decimetres, row-delta + zlib, -32768 = no data
    prov.u8.z     0 no-data, 1 landscape, 3 fill, 4 cliff interpolated, 5 cliff direct
    density.u8.z  source vertices per texel over the cliff layer, clamped at 255
    water.i16.z   water surface Z, same grid and no-data
    waterq.u8.z   0 dry, 1 water with a measured depth, 2 water whose depth is unknowable
    meta.json     georeference, game build, generator version, coverage, measured accuracy

The georeference is ``x_cm = -324700 + col*100``, ``y_cm = -375000 + row*100``, and it is
**vertex-aligned**: a texel's height belongs to that point exactly, not to a cell around it.
The two cliff provenance values are one layer split by how the texel was answered, so a
reader that knows only 4 sees 5 as "not landscape, not fill, not no-data" and is right. The
codec lives in ``satisfactory_mcp.domain.spatial.heightfield`` and the container reader in
``satisfactory_mcp.core.gameassets``; both are imported rather than reimplemented, and
``ooz`` is imported inside the latter so a machine without the ``gen`` extra still imports
every module and runs the tests.

Everything written here is derived from Coffee Stain's cooked assets, read out of the
reader's own install into a gitignored directory: the generator is committed and its output
never is.
