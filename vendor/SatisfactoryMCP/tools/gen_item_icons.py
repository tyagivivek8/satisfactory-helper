"""Cut data/local/icons/ -- one PNG per item -- out of the installed game.

    uv run --extra gen python tools/gen_item_icons.py

An icon is Coffee Stain's artwork, so this is a loader like ``tools/gen_map_image.py``: it
reads the reader's own install into gitignored ``data/local/`` and commits none of it.

``Docs/en-US.json`` gives every item descriptor an ``mSmallIcon`` naming a ``Texture2D``
package in ``FactoryGame-Windows.utoc``, looked up case-insensitively because five items
spell a directory differently from the container -- ``Mam``, ``Medkit``, ``Cyberwagon``
and ``Golfcart`` twice. Two pixel formats are in play, ``PF_DXT5`` on 634 of the 747 and
``PF_B8G8R8A8`` on 113, with no BC7 anywhere; both decoders hand back BGRA, which read as
``"RGBA"`` turns a copper ingot cyan instead of raising.

Measured on build 495413: of 750 classes carrying ``mForm``, 747 name an icon and all 747
decode, 41.1 MB of PNG in 12 s. The three with no picture name no texture in the dump at
all, so the frontend's text tile is their correct rendering rather than a fallback.
