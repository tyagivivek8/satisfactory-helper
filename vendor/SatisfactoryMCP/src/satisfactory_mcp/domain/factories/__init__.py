"""The factory graph and everything built on it: identity, labels, selection.

Kept as its own package rather than inside ``save`` because the graph is not a view of
a save file so much as the structure the save happens to describe -- identity, health,
layout and diff all want it, and each was re-deriving fragments of it.
