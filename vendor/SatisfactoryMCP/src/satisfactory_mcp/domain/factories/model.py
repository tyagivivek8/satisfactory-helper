"""The factory graph: one structure, three kinds of edge, built once from a save
projection and shared by identity, health, layout and diff.

The layers stay separate because no one of them identifies a factory. **material** is
what feeds what, orientable from the connector role, and it over-fragments a mature base
because a grown-together base is one belt web. **power** distinguishes poles from towers:
tower wires are a pure transmission backbone, so dropping them separates outposts without
subdividing the base. **transport** (trains, drones, trucks) is a deliberate connection
BETWEEN factories, and so belongs on a boundary rather than inside one.
