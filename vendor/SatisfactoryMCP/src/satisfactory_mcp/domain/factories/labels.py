"""Persistent factory names, anchored to machines rather than to positions or ids.

A label stores the SET of machine instance names it was created from. Instance names
were verified stable across saves -- 365 of 365 machines kept the same id and position
between two different save files -- so a set of them is a durable handle.

Matching uses **recall**, not Jaccard::

    recall = |anchors ∩ candidate| / |anchors|

That is what survives the edits a player actually makes:

* moving a machine       -- no effect at all, the id does not change
* adding a wing to it    -- recall stays 1.0; new machines are not in the denominator
* removing a few         -- recall dips slightly, still far above threshold
* rebuilding half of it  -- recall ~0.5, flagged for confirmation rather than lost

Jaccard would *punish growth*, which is exactly backwards: extending a factory is the
most common thing that happens to one. On a confirmed match the label re-anchors to
the current membership, so gradual rebuilding never accumulates drift.

Labels deliberately do not attach to a base or a line. Measured against a player's own
list, a real factory can be several material components (one Christmas factory is a
Tree Branch line plus a Candy Cane line) or part of one (a steel site and a tier 1&2
site inside a single belt-connected mass). Only an arbitrary machine set covers both.
