"""Floors: the storeys of a factory, recovered from geometry rather than read off the save.

Nothing in a ``.sav`` says "floor". What it does say is where every foundation piece sits,
and players build storeys at discrete repeated heights, so a floor is recoverable from
geometry alone. The unit is a PLATFORM -- a 4-connected flood fill of occupied 8 m cells --
and pointedly not a ``structure.py`` slab, which welds foundations through ramps and so
spans 287 m of Z where a ramp chain climbs a tower; slabs and the player's labels are still
read, but only to NAME the result. Within a platform the top surfaces cluster by single
linkage at ``CLUSTER_TOL_CM`` with no assumed storey pitch, because this world's module is
12 m mixed with 1-2 m half-steps that have to stay separate bands, and every band carries
its own cell area so a six-cell mezzanine reads as minor rather than as a storey. The
premise holds empirically: 99.87% of foundation pieces on platforms of 20 cells or more sit
within ``BAND_EPS_CM`` of a detected band.
