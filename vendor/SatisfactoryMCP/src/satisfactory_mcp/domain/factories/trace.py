"""Walking the material graph in the direction the stuff actually moves.

`factory_query` answers "what does this factory touch" between labelled sets. The question
underneath it is narrower and was unanswerable: *what feeds THIS machine* -- which, on a
live save mid-cutover, decides what you are allowed to repipe. Thirteen Oil Extractors sit
on the Spire nodes and twenty Fuel Generators are burning; repiping the wrong extractor
first drops several GW. The answer turns out to be **one** of the thirteen.

Direction is read, not inferred
-------------------------------
Every material edge already carries the connector role at each end -- `Output1`,
`Input0`, `PipeInputFactory` -- and the role is what orients it. Measured on the reference
save, of 2,300 connectors landing on a production machine:

* 2,002 are `Input`/`Output` (belts) and 126 are `PipeInputFactory`/`PipeOutputFactory`.
  **92.5% state their direction outright.**
* 172 are the bare `FGPipeConnectionFactory`, which does not -- and every single one of
  them is on an extractor or a generator. An extractor only ever produces and a generator
  only ever consumes, so its own role settles the edge. The resolution is exact, not a
  guess.

A trap worth recording: asking whether BOTH ends name a direction says 0% of 11,664 edges
are orientable, which is true and useless. The far end is nearly always a belt, and a belt
genuinely has no direction as an object -- only the machine end does.

Logistics is traversed, then named
----------------------------------
A trace from the generators touches 331 nodes at depth 72, almost all of it conveyor and
pipe segments. A path through that is unreadable, so the walk passes THROUGH logistics and
reports only machines in its table, which is the same thing `graph.query` does to find a
factory's boundary. What it also keeps is which RUNS those nodes belonged to
(`..world.logistics`), so the route can be named without the table growing 300 rows.
