"""Answer questions about a named factory, or about any machine set.

One entry point rather than eight tools, because every question shares the same two
steps: resolve a set of machines, then read something off it. What differs is only the
projection taken.

Every rate is carried twice, nameplate at the saved clock and measured over the productivity
window that closed when the save was written, and the two are never blended: a Foundry on
Solid Steel Ingot at 150% is nameplate 1.5x its recipe rate whether or not it has ever had
iron, and the pair is what says which. The safe direction is **opposite on the two sides** --
an unreadable machine charged in full makes a power figure conservative and an output figure
optimistic -- so a machine with no monitor contributes nothing to the measured flows and its
nameplate rate is parked in ``unmonitored_*``, leaving measured production a floor by
construction.

The one derived view worth more than the rest is ``balance``: per-item production minus
consumption across the set. Its sign is the interesting part --

* **positive** -- surplus, so it leaves the factory or backs up
* **negative** -- has to be fed in from outside
* **zero** -- made and consumed internally, which is what a self-contained line looks like

That single table answers "what does the steel factory need and what does it give me",
which no per-machine listing does.
