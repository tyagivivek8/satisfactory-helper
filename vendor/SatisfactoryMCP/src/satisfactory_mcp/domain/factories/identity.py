"""Candidate factories, from three signals that each fail alone.

Measured on a 316-hour save against the player's own list of what they built:

* **material components** -- 35 pieces, 19 of them fragments. Splits one Christmas
  factory into a Tree Branch line and a Candy Cane line. Too fine.
* **power islands** (towers removed) -- 6, one holding 476 machines. Separates
  outposts cleanly, does not subdivide the base at all. Too coarse.
* **spatial clustering alone** -- chains through shared infrastructure and merged an
  oil plant 900 m from the base into it. Wrong shape.

What works is the third signal the first two lack: **what a machine makes**. Steel
(50 machines, 95 m spread) and Tier 1&2 (54 machines, 197 m) are one belt-connected
mass topologically, but they sit 600 m apart and make different things. A grown-together
base defeats topology; it does not defeat geometry plus recipe.

So a *base* comes from power, a *line* from material, and a *cluster* from product and
position -- and they are offered as candidates rather than as an answer. Which grouping
is "a factory" is a naming decision, which is why labels attach to arbitrary machine
sets rather than to any one of these.
