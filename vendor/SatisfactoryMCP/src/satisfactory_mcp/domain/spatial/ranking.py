"""Score candidate build sites.

The score is a weighted sum of min-max normalised terms, and **every raw component is
returned alongside it** so a caller can re-weight for its own priorities rather than
trusting one opaque number.

Throughput counts **untapped, reachable** capacity only. Total capacity is the wrong
measure for "where should I build": a field whose nodes all have miners on them offers
nothing, and a field of well satellites offers nothing until the Pressurizer is
unlocked.

Terrain, where the reader has a heightfield, is read the same way: as raw numbers with a
small weight, never as a filter. Buildable is NOT flat -- foundations on stilts are
ordinary play and a cliff is sometimes the reason to build there -- so nothing here may
reject a site for being steep, wet or lumpy.
