"""Advisory region names -- layer 2 of the spatial design.

Layer 1 (``geo``) is the exact geometry every calculation uses; this module only attaches
human-readable names to coordinates, and **a region name must never feed a computation.**
``data/region_names.json`` is derived from the game's own ``FGMapAreaTexture``, whose
boundaries are exact polygon edges at 1.83 m, so a lookup's confidence is a statement about
this table's own resolution and nothing else. The file publishes a 256 m grid, which
``/api/regions`` serves and the map paints, and carries a 64 m one that lookups here prefer
-- a majority downsample at 256 m mislabels 14.1% of known world objects against 5.3% at
64 m -- while a table with no fine grid still loads and answers at its own resolution.
