"""How high the ground is: measured where the terrain field exists, sampled everywhere else.

Neither Docs.json nor the save carries terrain, so without a field the answer is a
POPULATION with its own count and spread, never an interpolated surface -- 608 resource
nodes (which rest ON the ground, so their Z *is* terrain, and which need no save at all),
8,347 foundation and wall pieces from ``FGLightweightBuildableSubsystem``, and 570
production buildings from their actor transforms. Nodes and built structures are separate
populations because a foundation is wherever the player put it -- level across a slope, on
stilts over a cliff -- so its Z is **built elevation, not ground**, and where the two
disagree that disagreement is the fill depth. ``spatial.heightfield`` adds a fourth kind of
evidence on a machine whose owner ran the generator: it is reported beside the populations,
carries the accuracy measured for the layer that answered, and is never averaged in.
