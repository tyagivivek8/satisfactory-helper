"""The 1 m terrain field: the on-disk format, and the loader that is only a loader.

``tools/gen_world_heightmap.py`` cuts the field out of the reader's own installed game and
writes it to the gitignored ``data/local/heightmap/``; this module is the byte format both
sides agree on and a reader over it. **Absent is the normal case** -- the repository ships
no terrain, so ``load_field()`` returns ``None`` on any machine where nobody ran the
generator, and every caller carries on without one. A raster is ``zlib`` over raw bytes,
the two int16 ones row-delta first, and a texel read costs a full decode of its plane, so
each plane is decoded lazily and cached. What each plane means is stated at the constant
that names it; the georeference is in ``meta.json`` and is never assumed.
