"""One ladder of purchasable schematics, priced against spendable stock.

The HUB milestones and the MAM tree are the same walk -- status, bill, shortfall,
prerequisites -- over two ``EST_*`` types, so both tools read this rather than each growing
its own vocabulary for the same four facts. What it cannot answer is whether a TIER is open
for purchase: no ``EST_Milestone`` in Docs.json carries a dependency of any kind, and the
Space Elevator gate that opens tiers rides on assets the dump does not ship (§6.4).
