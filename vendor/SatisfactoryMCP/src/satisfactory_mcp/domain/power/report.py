        Uptime is the projection's 300 s productivity monitor, carried by **524 of 570**
        records on the reference save. Both draws are reported because they answer different
        questions:

        * ``headroom_mw`` (nameplate) is the **safe** figure -- what is free if everything
          currently built ran at once. Energising a block can un-starve idle machines
          downstream, so this is the one not to exceed if you cannot watch it.
        * ``measured_headroom_mw`` is the **current** figure, weighted by how much of the
          factory is actually running.

        They are far apart: on the reference save nameplate draw is **6,901 MW** against a
        measured **2,389 MW**, so 649 MW of headroom nameplate against roughly
        **5,161 MW** actual.

        A machine with no productivity monitor is charged at full nameplate on both sides:
        unknown utilisation must not read as idle. Generators are capacity either way,
        since they burn to meet demand rather than at a rate of their own. Paused buildings
        are excluded from both sides.

        ``starved_generators`` is the exception to "generation is capacity": a plant with a
        dry input is not capacity, it is a number that will not appear when the grid asks
        for it. It names each one, since knowing WHICH plant is the whole value.
