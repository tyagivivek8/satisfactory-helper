"""Belt and pipe runs as queryable things, not just drawable ones.

The projection has carried every conveyor and pipeline polyline since schemas 12 and 13,
and until this module the only reader was the web map. Every TEXT surface either walked
through them silently (``trace_upstream`` traverses logistics and reports machines) or
never looked (``describe_location`` sampled foundations and buildings), so "is there a
pipe between these extractors and that platform" had no answer at all -- the assistant
twice told the player a build did not exist when the tools simply could not see it.

A **run** here is the unit a player talks about:

* for belts, the CHAIN -- the game's own grouping of consecutive conveyor pieces, split
  wherever a splitter, merger or machine interrupts the line. 1,909 chains over 3,085
  pieces on the reference world, so most runs are one piece and the long haulers are the
  group-by this module exists for.
* for pipes, the PIECE -- one placed pipeline actor, which is already one player-built
  stretch between two joints. Pipes have no chain; their network is a whole plumbing
  system (19 networks claim all 503 pipes here) and "the run" at network granularity
  would be a map-wide blob with no endpoints.

Lengths follow the drawn line: a span whose tangents schema 15 records is integrated along
its own spline, and a span with none is its chord. The projection stores tangents exactly
where a chord would be out by a centimetre or more, so both branches measure the curve the
map draws -- a chord across one bend was out by 16.4 m.

Endpoint attachment here is a NEAREST-PORT guess, labelled as one: what stands at an end is
answered geometrically, by the closest placed thing whose footprint (plus a port's reach)
covers the endpoint. ``None`` where nothing known stands there -- a pipe ending at a junction
reports the junction only when the material graph names it, because junctions, pumps and
valves are not placements in any projection table. Coordinates stay in the save's
centimetres; every distance routes through ``spatial.geo`` and every threshold is stated in
the metres it is compared in.

The EXACT answer to "what is on the end of this" is ``domain.world.logistics``, which
contracts the same conduit out of the save's own connection records; since schema 20 both
tables carry an actor index, so a run there and a run here share the ``chain:<n>`` and
``pipe:<row>`` ident and the two views can be read against each other.
