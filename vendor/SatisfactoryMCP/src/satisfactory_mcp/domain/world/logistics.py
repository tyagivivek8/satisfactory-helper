A conduit run here is every belt or pipe piece the save joins end to end between two

something the save states rather than something geometry guesses, and a belt passing over
a machine cannot become a belt feeding it. Direction comes from the connector role at a
machine end, then from the machine's own nature, and is declined where neither says.
