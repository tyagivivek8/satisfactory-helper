"""``as_of=``: a caller pins one world state, and every later call is consistent or refuses.

The hazard is a client making several calls while the game autosaves between them -- call 1
reads save A, call 3 reads save B, and the answer composed from both never existed in either
world. Nothing on the wire made that detectable, because a response names its FILENAME and an
autosave reuses filenames. ``identity.save_token`` is the name that does not repeat; this
module is what happens when a caller hands one back.
