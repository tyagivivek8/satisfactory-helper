A fluid buffer's own head lift is the height of the fluid standing in it, so one holding
less than `BUFFER_BALANCE_HEAD_M` of fluid cannot push out as fast as it takes in. A
pipeline pump no wire reaches still passes fluid while lifting nothing, so a line that
climbs past it stops climbing and no machine on it looks broken. See `docs/plumbing.md`.
