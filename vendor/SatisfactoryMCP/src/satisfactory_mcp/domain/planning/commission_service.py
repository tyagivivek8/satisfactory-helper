"""Everything ``commission_plan`` has to LOOK UP before a startup order can be printed.

``commission`` orders the waves. Around it sat two world questions: how much power the
grid actually has free -- which is a choice between two defensible numbers, not a
reading -- and which extractors already on the ground are load-bearing, because a wave
that repipes one of those takes running generation down mid-startup.
