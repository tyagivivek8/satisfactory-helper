"""What a subset of a solved plan costs and produces.

Every plan-level question that is not "solve it" turns out to be this: take some of the
processes, and total up their power, their item flows, and the Power Shards and
Somersloops they need. The shard bill is one call. Commissioning is this in a loop.

Two power figures, and the difference is not rounding
----------------------------------------------------
``mw_linear`` is what the LP optimised: power proportional to machine-equivalents.
``mw`` is the exact figure after whole machines are placed at a derived clock. Because
``clock**exponent`` is convex, running N whole machines below 100% draws LESS than the
linear estimate -- on a measured Spire Coast plan, 43,101 MW exact against 43,092
promised, 9.4 MW to the good.

So the identity that holds is::

    solution.net_mw == sum(mw_linear) - sink_mw          # exactly

and ``net_mw`` here (exact) is always at least as good. Headroom checks should use the
exact figure: it is the power the machines actually draw, and erring the other way would
reject a slice that fits.

``sink_mw`` belongs to the PLAN, not to any process -- an AWESOME Sink is charged per
belt line of sunk material and no column owns it. A subset therefore cannot attribute it,
and a partial slice reports 0 rather than a share invented by proration.
