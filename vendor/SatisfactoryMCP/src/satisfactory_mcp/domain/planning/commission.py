"""Bringing a plant online without blowing the fuse.

**This is a startup order, not a build order.** Building costs materials and never power --
a machine draws only when it runs -- so the whole plant may be constructed at leisure and
then energised block by block, under one constraint: at every step, the energised consumer
draw must stay within the headroom plus the generation from generators already receiving
fuel. Overshooting does not degrade gracefully in Satisfactory; the fuse blows and the
whole grid stops until it is reset by hand, so every step here is checked rather than
merely reported. ``track`` then matches the partition back against the save.
