"""What a stored plan's source selectors resolved to, and whether they still do.

``plan_id`` catches the world moving under a stored plan; it cannot catch the SELECTORS
moving, and they can -- ``region:Spire Coast`` is a name in a table this repository
generates, and re-deriving that table took it from 51 nodes to 18 with the plan untouched.
So a plan records, per location selector, what it resolved to, and a recall re-resolves and
reports the difference. A plan with no record is reported as "cannot be checked".
