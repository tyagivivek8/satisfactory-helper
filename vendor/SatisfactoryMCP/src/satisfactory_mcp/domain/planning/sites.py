"""Cutting one solved plan into named sites, and reporting what crosses the boundaries.

This is NOT a joint multi-site solver: nothing in the model prices distance, so a joint LP
with no per-site cap would collapse every site into one and would be RIGHT to, since a
split into rig, generator hall and resin plant is usually a preference the caller never
expressed as a constraint. What has a defensible answer is to declare the partition and
report it -- every flow crossing a boundary, as item, rate, direction and carrier count.

The unit of assignment is a PROCESS rather than a machine, so shared infrastructure lives
wholly in one site and exports: a water farm serving two coastal sites appears as an
interface that may not exist on the ground, and splitting it would mean per-MACHINE
assignment, which breaks the "a machine is in one place" rule that makes ``contested``
meaningful. An interface the caller named is reported even at zero, because a decoupled
design is characterised entirely by one flow BEING zero and a table of nonzero rows would
omit exactly that.
