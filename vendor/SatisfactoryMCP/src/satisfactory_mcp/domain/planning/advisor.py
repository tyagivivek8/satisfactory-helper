"""Rank alternate recipes by MARGINAL VALUE, via counterfactual solves.

Solve the player's objective without the candidate, then with it, and report the
delta in real units. That is a far better answer than a tier list, because a
recipe's worth depends entirely on what the player already has -- e.g. both
turbofuel alternates can be worth nothing to someone who already owns Diluted Fuel.

Methodology rules, each learned from a wrong answer during design:

* The counterfactual must add **every new recipe of the schematic**. Two alternate
  schematics carry three recipes, not one.
* The baseline must include everything the player actually has. A demo that omitted
  the 32 coal generators they had already built concluded turbofuel was worthless.
* Report deltas per objective and never collapse them into one score without naming
  the tradeoff: a recipe can be useless for power and excellent for parts.
* Deltas ramp, they do not step. Near a binding constraint a coarse sweep reports a
  flat delta and then a cliff, both wrong.
* **The baseline must be the same quantity plan_factory reports.** Every scenario
  here is built by ``planning.scenario.build_scenario``, the one construction path,
  so raw material arrives through real extractor processes on real nodes -- power
  charged, count capped by node availability. Feeding the same basket in as free
  ``raw_caps`` instead inflated the northern baseline from 92,269 MW to 171,882 MW.
  The deltas mostly survived that, because the bias cancels between the two solves,
  but the absolute number the user is invited to compare against plan_factory did
  not.
