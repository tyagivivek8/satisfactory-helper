"""Rank whole ROUTES to an item, with the consequences of each computed.

``alternates_for_item`` answers "which recipes make this". This module answers the
harder question: given the recipes this save has unlocked, what does each way of
making the thing actually COST, end to end -- raw per unit, buildings, power,
byproducts that need an outlet, and machine types the player owns but has never
placed.

Enumeration: ONE PINNED PRODUCER PER ROUTE
------------------------------------------
A route is not a recipe, it is a sub-chain: the interesting comparison is
``Crude -> Alt HOR -> Diluted Fuel`` against ``Crude -> Fuel``, not one recipe
against another. So a route is defined by pinning the recipe that makes the final
item and deleting its RIVALS from the recipe set, then letting the LP choose
everything upstream. Deleting the rivals is what makes it a route rather than a
blend: with them present the LP simply mixes producers and there is nothing to
compare.

Why not expand a tree: Recycled Plastic and Recycled Rubber form a genuine 2-cycle
and this save has both, so there is no correct depth limit -- and the LP exploits
that cycle in the real answer (the best Plastic route runs through it).

Why not read shadow prices off one solve: the required outputs -- machine counts,
byproduct outlets, which building is unlocked but unbuilt -- are not dual
quantities at all. Duals would also be non-unique here, because min_raw LPs over
this recipe set are degenerate, and a reduced cost prices one marginal unit at the
current basis rather than the cost of committing to a chain that is not in the
basis.

What this method CANNOT answer, all consequences of the pinning:

* It cannot compare two chains that end in the same recipe. ``Residual Fuel`` fed
  by Alt HOR and ``Residual Fuel`` fed by the base Plastic recipe are one route;
  the LP picks the cheaper and the readout names it, but the runner-up is gone.
* It cannot price a deliberate BLEND of two producers, which real factories run.
* Deleting a rival also deletes it as a source of its OTHER products, so a route
  can be charged for replacing a by-product it never wanted to lose.
* Raw materials are abstract. Nothing here knows whether a reachable node of that
  resource exists, which is ``plan_factory``'s job.
* It ranks on ONE resource, because a per-unit column whose denominator changes
  between rows is not a comparison. A route that spends a different resource
  entirely therefore cannot be placed in the order at all, and a route that spends
  several is ranked on the one the most routes share -- the rest are named in the
  notes, never priced. ``per_resource`` re-runs the whole table on another one.

Three solves per route, because one objective cannot answer the question
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ``min_machines`` at the requested rate -- the fewest-buildings floor, and how
   the raw bill looks when buildings are what you are short of.
2. ``max_item`` with the primary resource capped at ``PROBE_RATE`` -- the headline.
   This is the "60 crude -> 160 Fuel" number and it is scale-free.
3. ``min_raw`` at the requested rate with the primary resource pinned to what
   solve 2 proved possible -- the buildable plan, and a documented lexicographic
   tie-break for the degeneracy the design spec warns about: minimise the scarce
   resource first, then total raw.

Step 3 is needed because a bare ``min_raw`` sums every resource with weight one and
therefore trades crude against water. Measured on this save: Recycled Plastic came
back at 0.94 m3 crude per Plastic with zero water, when 0.33 crude was available for
the price of some water. Water is effectively unlimited on this map, so that trade
is always the wrong way round.

Extraction is deliberately NOT modelled. A route comparison is about the chain, and
charging oil pumps here would make the per-unit economics depend on which nodes the
save happens to have free. That also makes the figures reproduce the design spec's
oil finding exactly: 60 crude -> 160 Fuel at 30.00 net MW per m3/min crude via
Alt HOR + Diluted Fuel, against 40 Fuel and 7.58 MW for the base Fuel recipe.
