"""One place where a planning request becomes a solved plan.

``plan_factory``, ``plan_layout`` and ``diff_vs_save`` all run the same sequence: build a
scenario, reject an empty source selection or an unusable export, solve, and on failure
work out why. **This module renders nothing** -- a failure comes back as a headline plus
notes and the tool decides how to show it, so the sequence stays usable by a test or a
script as well.
