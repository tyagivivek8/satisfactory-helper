"""LP/MILP factory optimizer.

Formulation
-----------
One variable per *process* -- a recipe at a fixed (clock, sloops) mode, an extractor
on a given resource+purity, a generator on a given fuel, or a sink. Plus one
variable per raw input, export and sink flow.

Power is modelled as a pseudo-item ``__MW__`` so the power balance is just another
mass-balance row. That keeps every objective linear.

**Every item's balance is an equality.** ``net >= 0`` is wrong: a byproduct with no
consumer does not vanish, it fills a pipe and stalls the line. Exports and sinks are
explicit whitelists, so anything not exportable or sinkable must be consumed exactly.

Two-phase lexicographic solve is mandatory: with machine counts only bounded below,
any larger count is equally optimal, and an unguarded solve returns counts of 1e12.
Phase 1 optimises the goal; phase 2 pins it and minimises machines.

Clocks are discrete modes, never a continuous variable: power is ``c**1.32``, which
is non-convex, and for fixed throughput power strictly decreases in machine count,
so a min-power objective would drive machines to infinity.
