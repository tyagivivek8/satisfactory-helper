"""What would unlocking a recipe be worth to THIS plan?

One counterfactual per candidate -- solve, solve again with the recipe bolted on, report
the difference -- swept over every locked alternate without pre-filtering, because a recipe
that opens a chain the plan cannot currently reach touches none of its items and is exactly
the interesting case. Every delta is an UPPER bound: ``_needed_buildings`` adds a machine
the player has never built to the buildable set so the candidate is not judged infeasible
for that reason, and names it. A zero is an answer, so ``tried`` is reported alongside the
winners rather than only the winners.
