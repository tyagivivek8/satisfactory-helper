"""Turn a solved plan into a buildable schematic: blocks, buses and floors.

This is a SCHEMATIC, not a blueprint. It answers "what modules do I build, what feeds
what, how much space, and what goes on which floor". It deliberately does not produce
world coordinates: there is no terrain heightmap in any data available here, so belt
pathfinding and foundation alignment would be invention rather than derivation.

Three ideas do the work:

**Blocks come from throughput, not taste.** 46 Refineries consuming 1380 m3/min of
crude cannot sit on one manifold when a Mk2 pipe carries 600 -- that is 3 lines, so it
is 3 blocks of ~16. Line count *is* block count, which makes the split derived rather
than arbitrary.

**Connections are buses, not pairings.** The LP gives net balances, not who feeds whom.
Recovering specific producer-consumer pairs is a min-cost flow problem with no unique
answer absent geometry, so each item gets one bus that producers feed and consumers
draw from. That is also what a manifold physically is.

**Floors come from chain depth.** Stage = longest path through the item graph, so
extractors land on the bottom floor and generators on top, with a logistics deck
between each pair. Depth is computed on the graph's CONDENSATION, because the recipe
graph genuinely contains cycles -- Recycled Plastic and Recycled Rubber consume each
other's output. Collapsing each strongly connected component makes the graph acyclic
and puts cycle members on one floor, which is also right physically: they have to be
built together.

    Floors follow CHAIN DEPTH, which is a correctness property -- a consumer sits above
    its producer, so the schematic reads in build order. It is not a physics property.
    Fluids do not care about chain depth: a pipe running downhill is free while one
    running uphill needs head, and water in particular can only be drawn at sea level, so
    it always starts at the bottom whatever the chain says.

    Chain-depth ordering therefore tends to make everything climb. On a measured oil plan
    it put extractors at F0, refineries F2, blenders F4, generators F6 -- water up two
    storeys, crude, heavy oil residue and fuel up one each. Reordering by hand so the
    water extractors sit at sea level under the blenders, generators one above and
    refineries on top leaves only water and fuel climbing one storey each, and lets
    residue and crude fall for free.

    Reporting this was once the whole answer, on the grounds that the right stack depends
    on terrain and on how much the player will pump. `order_floors_by="head"` now searches
    the orders too -- naming a cost and then defaulting to the arrangement that pays it
    was the gap: on the measured oil plan chain order lifts 66 pipe-storeys where 52 is
    available, and water climbs four floors when two will do.

    ``pumps`` is per riser and real: metres come from the actual floors crossed, and head
    per pump from ``mDesignPressure``. It is a LOWER bound for the same reason the trunk
    figure is -- pipe friction and the head a full pipe holds are not modelled.
