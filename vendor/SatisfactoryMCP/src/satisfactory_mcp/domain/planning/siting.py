"""Where a stored plan STANDS: an origin, an orientation and a footprint.

A plan stores the REQUEST and re-solves on recall (see ``store``), which answers what to
build -- and, until now, nothing about where. Every question after the solve ("how big,
which direction, does what stands here match it") was answered outside the tool with hand
geometry, because the plan had no coordinates to anchor those questions to.

So a plan may now RECORD its siting. Record, not constrain: nothing here feeds the LP,
moves a machine, or claims the site is level. The siting is the player's own statement of
where the plan goes, kept beside the player's own statement of what the plan is, and the
tools that already answer spatial questions (``diff_vs_save``, ``show_on_map``) read it.

Conventions, chosen to match what already exists rather than invented:

* **Origin is the footprint's CENTRE**, in metres, on save axes (+X east, +Y south) --
  the same axes every tool here quotes and the web map plots.
* **Yaw is degrees about world Z, positive turning +X towards +Y** -- exactly the
  convention the save stores machine facing with and ``footprintCorners`` in the web
  frontend draws with, so a siting's rectangle and a machine's rectangle rotate the same
  way on the same map.
* **Footprint is width x depth in metres**, width along the site's own X before yaw.
  Either given by the caller, or the square ``plan_layout`` already computes
  (``Layout.site_side_m``: the side that fits the largest floor) -- and the record says
  WHICH, because a layout-computed square is an estimate and a measured pad is not.

Stored as a defaulted dict on ``Plan``, the same discipline ``provenance`` used: an old
plan file without the key still loads, and an empty dict means "not sited", which every
reader treats as the feature simply being absent.
