"""Which raw input a plan cannot get, and why -- the other half of INFEASIBLE.

``plan_factory`` already names the buildings a plan needs but the world has not
built (``must build first: Blender``). It said nothing at all about the resource end,
and that asymmetry cost a real session: a rocket-fuel plan returned a bare
INFEASIBLE, ``explain_byproducts`` correctly reported that no byproduct was stuck, and
the actual cause -- Nitrogen Gas exists **only** as resource-well satellites, which
need a Pressurizer this world has not unlocked -- had to be recovered by hand from a
node scan and a recipe listing.

**The verdict is the LP's, never a graph walk**, for the same reason ``byproducts``
gives: a backward walk from the target over-reports (it names every raw input of every
route, including routes the plan would never take) and a forward "what can I make from
what I have" closure under-reports, because Recycled Plastic and Recycled Rubber each
need the other's product and yet the PAIR net-creates both out of Fuel. So one probe
does the work: re-solve with a free supply of every raw resource the scope cannot
currently produce, and let ``raw_used`` say which of them the plan actually wanted.

That gives two honest outcomes, and the negative one is worth as much as the positive:

* the probe solves -> every resource it drew on is demonstrably part of the cause,
  because the only change was making it available;
* the probe is still infeasible -> raw supply is **not** the problem, which rules out
  a whole family of guesses and points back at the byproduct balance.

What it cannot do is apportion blame. Two missing resources that are both needed are
both reported, with no claim about which is "the" blocker, and a resource the probe
used only because it was cheap is still reported -- the probe proves it was wanted,
not that it was unavoidable. The WHY beside each one is a separate, purely factual
read of the node table (none in scope / behind a locked building / already tapped),
and it is quoted as counts so a wrong inference is visible rather than buried.
