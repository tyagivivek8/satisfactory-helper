"""Which nodes feed which trunk line.

A solved plan says "13 Oil Extractors at 250% on Crude Oil, 3,450 m3/min". A player
standing on the Spire Coast needs the next sentence: a Mk2 pipe carries 600 m3/min, so
that is **six trunks**, and *these* nodes go on each one.

Nothing else in this project answers that. `logistics` counts lines
(``ceil(rate / capacity)``) which is the right total and says nothing about which nodes
share one, and the layout schematic starts at the factory edge with the crude already
arrived. The gap between them is the walk a player actually has to plan.

Two things this deliberately does not do
----------------------------------------
**No routing.** There is no terrain here, so a path is invented the moment it is drawn.
What comes out is a grouping plus straight-line distances, which is a lower bound on pipe
and is labelled as one.

**No routing, but pump counts are now real.** For a long time this said head-per-pump was
a game constant with no source, and refused to give a number. It is ``mDesignPressure`` in
Docs.json -- 20 m on a Mk1 pump, 50 m on a Mk2 -- and was there the whole time under a name
nobody grepped for. Counts are still a LOWER bound, because pipe friction and the head a
full pipe holds on its own are not modelled, and they quote the best pump the player has
actually unlocked rather than the best that exists.

Why a chain and not a cluster
-----------------------------
A trunk is a *line*, not a blob: pipes are laid end to end and each node joins the one
running past it. So nodes are ordered along a nearest-neighbour chain from the node
furthest from the destination inward, and the chain is cut whenever the next node would
overflow the pipe. Capacitated k-means would give tighter blobs and a worse answer -- two
nodes 40 m apart but on opposite sides of the run are not on the same pipe.
