"""Bill of materials: the flattened raw and intermediate bill for a target rate.

**This is the LP, not a recursive expansion, and that is not a preference.** The
design spec's ban on ``plan_chain`` applies verbatim here: Recycled Plastic
(30 Rubber + 30 Fuel -> 60 Plastic) and Recycled Rubber (30 Plastic + 30 Fuel ->
60 Rubber) form a genuine 2-cycle and this save has both unlocked, so a tree walk
has no correct depth limit -- it either stops early and understates, or recurses
for ever. Worse, it is silent about which of the two it did. The LP has no depth at
all: it solves one flow balance per item and the cycle is just two more columns.
The loop, when the solver uses one, is detected and named in the response, because
a bill whose Plastic line reads 200/min for a 10/min export is not an error and the
reader has to be told why.

So this module is a presentation layer over ``solve``, and deliberately a thin one.
It answers a narrower question than ``plan_factory``: no nodes, no extractors, no
geography. Charging extraction here would make the bill depend on which miners this
save happens to have free, which is a different question and ``plan_factory``'s.

The recipe choice is the answer, not a detail
---------------------------------------------
An item's bill is only defined once you fix which recipe makes each intermediate,
and alternates move the numbers by more than any rounding: on Reinforced Iron Plate
the base chain costs **120 Iron Ore/min per 10 plates**, and the alternates this
save has unlocked bring that down. So every row names the recipe that produced it,
and ``only_recipes`` / ``exclude_recipes`` let a caller pin the chain and get an
arithmetic answer they can check by hand.

The degeneracy, and the one tie-break applied
---------------------------------------------
``min_raw`` LPs over this recipe set are degenerate -- equally optimal vertices
give materially different raw vectors -- and a bare ``min_raw`` also sums every
resource with weight one, so it will trade crude against water. Water is effectively
unlimited on this map, so that trade is always the wrong way round. The documented
tie-break is lexicographic: **minimise every other resource with water free, then
pin those and minimise water.** Whatever degeneracy survives that is labelled in the
response rather than presented as the number.
