"""Named, persisted plans.

**The request is stored, never the solution.** A solve depends on unlocked recipes, free
nodes and built buildings, so a stored solution would keep answering about a world that no
longer exists; re-solving on recall answers about the world as it is now, and a saved
``plan_id`` that no longer matches says the world moved rather than the plan. Stored per
world under ``saveIdentifier``: a plan for one world is meaningless in another.
