"""Recalling a stored plan: what its arguments were, and what this call overrode.

A stored plan is a stored planning REQUEST, so merging one back in is a planning
decision rather than an argument-parsing detail of the tool that happens to take it.

It is also the one place every planning tool passes through -- plan_factory, plan_layout,
diff_vs_save, commission_plan and rank_unlocks all reach a stored plan through here -- so
it is where the field check belongs. Written into each tool instead it would be five
copies, and the copy that was forgotten would be the tool that answered silently.

#: The declared default of every stored planning argument. Needed because MCP fills
#: defaults in before the tool sees them, so "objective" always arrives as "max_mw" and

#: The cost is one honest limitation: recalling a plan cannot explicitly reset a
#: parameter back to its default. Edit the plan (save_as over the same name) for that.
