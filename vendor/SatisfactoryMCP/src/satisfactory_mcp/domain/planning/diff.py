"""What to change to get from the factory in the save to the factory in the plan.

The hard part is not arithmetic, it is deciding which machine that already exists
COUNTS toward the plan. Three rules do the work, and all three are forced by what the
save actually stores rather than chosen for elegance.

**Identity, never position.** A manufacturer is identified by ``(building, recipe)``,
because ``mCurrentRecipe`` is a per-machine setting and is exactly what the player
would have to change. A generator is identified by its building alone, because a
generator has no recipe -- its fuel is whatever is piped into it, so two fuels are one
build job. An extractor is identified by the node it occupies, which the save records
directly and which is therefore an exact join.

Class-only matching for manufacturers is the failure this design exists to avoid. This
world has 36 Refineries; 5 run Alternate Heavy Oil Residue and 31 run seven other
recipes, making copper, plastic and alumina. "You have 36 Refineries, build 10" is
arithmetically true and would tell the player to break their copper line. Off-recipe
machines are reported as a reuse pool and never counted.

**Position reports; it never matches.** The region raster is +/-256 m advisory and
splits this world's single 458-building site across three region names, and 300 m
single-linkage merges the oil plant and the main base, which stand only ~900 m apart,
into one cluster. No spatial rule separates them, so none is used for matching.
Proximity decides only what to MENTION: which idle machines are plausibly reusable, and
what stands among the plant without being in the plan.

**Where identity is unavailable, emit a range.** Water Extractors have no recipe, and
all 23 in this save point at ``FGWaterVolume`` objects that are not node keys (OQ5), so
they cannot be matched at all. 31 needed against 23 built is reported as "build 8..27":
the lower bound counts every pump in the world, the upper counts only those standing
among the plan's own machines. A single number there would be a confident lie in
whichever direction it fell.
