"""Everything ``plan_layout`` has to WORK OUT before a schematic can be written down.

``build_layout`` turns a solution into blocks, buses and floors. What sat around it in
the tool was a second job: solving the plan in the first place, finding the best pump
this save can place so a riser count is against a real tier, asking which fluids the
floor order makes climb, and then -- per ``detail`` -- one more domain question each.
Those questions are genuinely different (a site partition, a construction bill, a trunk
plan, a fit against an existing platform) but they are all lookups, not sentences, so
they answer here and the presenter decides which of them is worth a table.
