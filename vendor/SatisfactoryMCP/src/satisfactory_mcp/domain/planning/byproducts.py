"""Why an equality-balanced plan has no answer: find the byproduct with no outlet.

Every item balance in the LP is an equality, so a byproduct that nothing consumes
does not silently vanish -- it makes the plan infeasible, or (worse, because it is
quiet about it) collapses the plan to nothing and lets a different resource win.
``plan_factory`` can only say "infeasible" and suggest adding something to
``exports``. Working out *which* item is stuck, and what could possibly eat it, is
the job this module does.

**The verdict is always the LP's, never a graph walk.** Two static analyses are
tempting here and both are wrong on this user's own recipe set:

* "an item with no consumer is stuck" misses the real trap. Polymer Resin has two
  unlocked consumers (Residual Plastic, Residual Rubber) and is stuck anyway,
  because what they make -- Plastic and Rubber -- has nowhere to go either.
* "an item whose consumers reach an outlet is fine" over-reports the other way. A
  grounded-chain search says Plastic terminates, via Empty Canister -> Packaged
  Liquid Biofuel -> a Biomass Burner. True as a chain, useless as a plan: nothing
  in a crude-oil scope can supply the biofuel. A chain test ignores co-inputs.

So candidates come from a *relaxed solve* -- every produced item made exportable,
deliberately the naive ``net >= 0`` formulation, used only as a probe and never
shown as a plan -- and each candidate is then confirmed by re-solving with that one
item opened up. An item is named as the blocker only when opening it alone
measurably rescues the plan, and the gain is quoted in the caller's own objective.

The graph work that remains is explanatory, not decisive: which recipes would
consume the item, split by whether this save has unlocked them, and whether the
chain out of it dead-ends in a closed loop. That last one is the trap the design
spec names: Recycled Plastic and Recycled Rubber consume each other's product, and
no non-negative combination of the two absorbs either -- the pair net-CREATES both
out of Fuel, so it can never soak up a resin surplus.
