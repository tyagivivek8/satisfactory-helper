"""The formatting PRIMITIVES: tables, envelopes, footers, numbers and rates.

This file owns HOW a table looks and never WHICH table a tool returns. Context budget is the
binding constraint: every response is read by a model, and all 291 automatable recipes in the
tightest possible TSV is already ~25k characters. The layout rules live here and are not
restated per formatter:

  * compact TSV, not JSON -- the win is dropping repeated keys and braces
  * names in rows, IDs once in a footer
  * scoped aggregates BEFORE rows (an unscoped total is often actively misleading)
  * truncation envelope counts DATA ROWS ONLY (miscounting misleads the model)
  * coordinates in metres, not raw centimetres
