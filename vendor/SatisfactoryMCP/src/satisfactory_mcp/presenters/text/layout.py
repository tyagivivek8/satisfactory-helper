"""A layout report as TSV: the stack, and whichever table ``detail`` asked for.

Six tables share one header and one pile of caveats, because they are six views of the SAME
schematic -- change ``detail`` and the plan underneath does not move. The caveats are what
stop a schematic being read as a blueprint: there is no terrain data here, so routing,
lengths and world coordinates are absent.
