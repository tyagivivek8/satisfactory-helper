"""A startup sequence as TSV: the waves, and the warnings that make them safe.

The table is two interleaved row shapes -- a summary line per wave and the processes inside
it -- because the numbers that decide whether the sequence is safe, what it costs and what
it hands back, belong to the wave rather than to any row in it. The rest is notes, because
the arithmetic is four columns and the ways a player can come to grief treating it as a
build order are not.
