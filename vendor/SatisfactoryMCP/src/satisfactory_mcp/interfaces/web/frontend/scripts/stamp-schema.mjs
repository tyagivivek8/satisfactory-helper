/* Put the provenance header back on top of the generated API schema.

 * where a file came from to disappear. Chaining this after the generator makes the header
 * part of generating rather than part of remembering.
 *
 * Idempotent: running it twice does not stack two headers.

 * Committed on purpose: it is the checked-in record of the API this page was built
 * against, so a diff here is the server's surface changing and is worth reading. It is
 * also why \`npm run check\` needs no running server.
 *
 * READ WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT SAY. Every JSON endpoint under
 * \`interfaces/web/routers/\` is self-typed -- it declares a \`response_model\`, so its whole
 * body is described below and this file is authoritative for it, with no exception left.
 * \`/api/worlds\` was the last: DEFERRED for as long as it forwarded the loader's own save
 * headers, because the useful model deleted eight keys from every row -- a change to what
 * the endpoint SENDS -- and converted the day that body change was approved and made. The
 * comment above \`worlds()\` in routers/world.py names the deleted keys. \`/api/mapimage\`,
 * \`/api/maptiles/…\`, \`/api/icons/…\` and \`/api/events\` send pictures and a stream and have
 * no JSON body to describe at all.
 *
 * \`api-types.ts\` IS GONE, and that is what the paragraph above is worth saying. It held the
 * frontend's own observations of the endpoints that published no schema, read off real
 * payloads from a real save; those endpoints publish one now, and \`api-shapes.ts\` re-exports
 * the components below under the names the page uses. What was in that file and was never a
 * payload lives with the code that uses it instead: the drawing tuples in \`geometry.ts\` and
 * \`ApiError\` in \`api.ts\`.
 *
 * What this file has always been authoritative for is the other half and still is: which
 * paths exist, which query parameters each takes, and what a validation error looks like.
 *
 * NOTHING IMPORTS THE COMPONENT NAMES FROM HERE DIRECTLY except \`api-shapes.ts\`, which
 * re-exports them under the names the page already used. One indirection, so that a
 * converted endpoint changes one line in one file rather than every module that draws its
 * payload -- and so that the page's names stay the page's while their DEFINITIONS come
 * from the server. \`floors.ts\` predates it and reaches in here itself.
 *
 * Committed on purpose (see above), which is also why regenerating it after a server
 * change is part of the same commit: a checked-in record that lags the server is worse
 * than none, because a diff here is supposed to mean the surface moved.
