/* Floor mode: the same map, one storey at a time.
 *
 * NOT A SECOND RENDERER. Everything on screen in floor mode was drawn by the module that always
 * drew it, and this file only decides which of those pieces are on the floor being looked at.
 * `/api/floors` answers the one thing a client cannot derive -- WHICH floor each thing is on --
 * so the only geometry rule here is `standsOn`, for the layers the payload does not cover.
 *
 * THE JOINS, because they are all different:
 *
 *   * a machine, extractor, generator or belt attachment -- BY INSTANCE ID. A band lists them.
 *   * a belt run BY CHAIN, a pipe run BY ITS ROW, keyed by the number the belt and pipe
 *     payloads already carry.
 *   * a foundation piece -- BY POSITION in `/api/structures`. A lightweight buildable has no
 *     instance name at all, so `deck_rows` is the only name a deck can be listed by.
 *   * storage -- BY WHERE IT STANDS, because the decomposition does not decompose it.
 *   * the power grid -- BY WHERE ITS ENDS STAND. `/api/floors` has never grouped a wire, so
 *     this file places them with `standsOn`, twice, because a wire has two ends. Each end is
 *     judged at its ANCHOR rather than at its drawn endpoint, because an endpoint is a
 *     connector 7 m over a Mk1 pole and 24 m over a tower. See `onThisFloor` and the power
 *     branch of `applyFilter`.
 *
 * THE GROUND is a pseudo-floor and not a band, because a miner stands on a resource node up to
 * 28 m off any deck and plumbing hugs the ground -- neither is on floor zero, and putting them
 * there would claim a measurement the page does not have. The row says WHICH claim it is,
 * because without a heightfield "on terrain" degrades to "off-deck".
