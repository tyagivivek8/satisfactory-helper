/* The right-click inspector: "what is here?", answered where the question is asked.
 *
 * Its own module because it is the one thing on this page that is not a layer: it draws
 * nothing, owns no group, appears in no checkbox, and answers about a point the player picked
 * rather than about anything the save contains. /api/inspect answers the three things a site
 * starts with -- the named region, the measured elevation, the nearest nodes -- so the only
 * work here is turning a latlng back into game coordinates and laying the answer out.
