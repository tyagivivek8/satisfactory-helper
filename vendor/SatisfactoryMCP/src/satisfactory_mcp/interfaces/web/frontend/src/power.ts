 * DIRECTION MARKS because power has no direction to draw: a circuit is one connected pool of
 * supply and demand, and a wire carries whatever the pool needs whichever way it needs it.
 *
 * `/api/floors` groups belt chains and pipe rows and has never carried a wire, so floors.ts

 * -- the canvas antialiases it across two or three -- so what a reader sees is the colour
 * composited over the ground at something like 0.6, where a dE 26.7 swatch is worth about dE
 * 15 of real contrast. A single colour also cannot be far from both grounds this is drawn
 * over: the game's artwork is a pale warm tan with cyan water (binned to a 16-level cube, its
 * six commonest tones are #486878, #888878, #a8a898, #988878, #4898a8 and #989888) while
 * `plain` mode is near-black. A dark casing and a light core can be, because whichever way the
 * ground goes one half of the pair separates from it and the other half is the reason the line
 * still has a colour.
 *
 * All three below are measured in CIE Lab against the CURRENT full table, cross-owner nearest

 * rather than black because a near-black casing lands in the middle of the map's tightest grey
 * cluster.
 *
 * Against the artwork it is dE 48.4 from the nearest ground tone on the desert and the coast
