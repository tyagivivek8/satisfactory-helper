 * the address bar changes under an open tab.
 *
 * ITS OWN MODULE because applying a fragment means reaching the world picker, the base map
 * and the viewport, and no other file can reach all three: state.ts imports nothing, map.ts
 * is below tiles.ts in the graph, and worlds.ts is imported BY the loader it would have to
 * call. This file sits above all of them and is imported only by main.ts.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO is decide anything. Every branch below ends in a call that is already
 * the page's one way of doing that thing -- `reload()`, `setMode()`, `map.setView`. A
 * fragment is a request to press the buttons the page already has.
