/* When the page fetches, and what a reply is allowed to do when it lands.
 *
 * WHAT is fetched is declared per feature in registry.ts; what is here is the machinery every
 * entry shares -- the two waves, the epoch guard that drops a reply nobody is waiting for, the
 * clear a failure owes the layers it was going to draw into, and the mark on screen while a
 * switch is in flight.
 *
 * THIS FILE MUST IMPORT NO MODULE THAT REGISTERS A FETCH: those imports are what would make a
 * registration reachable without main.ts's FEATURES block naming it. See registry.ts.
 * `regions.ts` is named below because /api/regions is the one fetch outside both waves.
