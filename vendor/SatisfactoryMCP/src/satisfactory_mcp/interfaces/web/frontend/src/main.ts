/* The map. Reads /api, draws markers, and refetches when the game writes a save.
 *
 * Two coordinate facts drive everything below.
 *
 *   1. The API already speaks metres. Nothing here divides by 100 -- if a number looks
 *      like centimetres, the bug is server-side.
 *   2. Satisfactory is +X east and +Y SOUTH, while Leaflet's CRS.Simple is +lat north.
 *      So a point is plotted at [-y, x], and that negation lives in map.ts and nowhere else.
 *
 * And one content fact: every string that reaches a popup or a label is DATA, so popup()
 * escapes everything by default and the few rows that need markup say so with html().
 *
 * This file is the entry point and draws nothing. What it holds is the ORDER of two things
 * neither of which is visible from inside a module: which map events are listened for, and
 * what happens on load.
