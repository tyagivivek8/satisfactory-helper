 * owns to save a WeakMap probe per mark, and optional because an object that never passed
 * through the code that sets one does not have it. `_handlingClick`, `_update` and `layerId`
 * are real Leaflet internals that `@types/leaflet` does not publish -- three places where
 * this page is coupled to Leaflet 1.9.4, greppable before an upgrade.

 * business, and this is only enough to ask it.
 *
 * Every field is optional and the groups are alternatives, because the layers this filters are
 * joined five different ways: a machine by its instance id, a belt chain or pipe row by the
 * key `/api/floors` groups it under, a foundation piece by its position in `/api/structures`
