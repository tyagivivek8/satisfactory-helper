/* ------------------------------------------------- what is in a container, as the game draws it */

/* THE INVENTORY GRID: a container's contents as tiles of the reader's own game artwork with
 * the quantity in the corner, rather than as a table of names.
 *
 * Here rather than in either feature because there are two callers -- a crate and a storage
 * box -- and "what is in it" has to be one idea on this map rather than two that resemble
 * each other.
 *
 * THE NAMES DO NOT GO AWAY, which is the one thing a grid must not get wrong. Every tile
 * carries its name three times over: `title` for a pointer, `alt` for a screen reader and for
 * the tile whose picture never arrives, and once more as text in the caption line under the
 * grid, which is the copy that needs no pointer, no hover and no working icon directory. The
 * caption is why this returns ROWS rather than one lump of markup: a caller assembling the
 * two itself could leave one out.
 *
 * THE URL IS UNTAGGED. `/api/icons/{desc}` serves a `?v=<build>` request `immutable` for a
 * year and an untagged one `no-cache` with an ETag, and this page cannot carry the tag: it
 * would have to learn it from a probe, which means naming a descriptor class up front and
 * hoping the reader's own generated directory holds it. The directory is optional and some
 * item classes ship no picture at all, so a probe is a guess whose failure mode is silently
 * unversioned URLs. Untagged plus an ETag makes a revalidation a 304 rather than 50 KB.
 *
 * NOTHING IS FETCHED UNTIL A POPUP OPENS: Leaflet holds a bound popup as a STRING and builds
 * its DOM on the click, so these <img> tags are markup rather than requests for as long as
 * the card is shut.
