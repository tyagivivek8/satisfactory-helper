 * or dismantles something with a full inventory, and they DELETE THEMSELVES the moment they
 * are emptied -- so every crate on this map is live information by construction, which is not
 * true of a storage box. It is also not the same drawing problem as `placements.ts` next
 * door: a crate is not a buildable, the docs dump carries no clearance for a `BP_Crate_C`,
 * and a 2 m prop at world zoom is a hundredth of a pixel -- so it is a mark at a fixed pixel
 * size rather than a footprint.
