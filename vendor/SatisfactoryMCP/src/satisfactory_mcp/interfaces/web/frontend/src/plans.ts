 * about a rectangle nobody has poured yet -- so it is drawn as an outline over the terrain
 * and the concrete rather than as a filled area that would hide the very things a reader
 * opened it to check: does the pad clear the belt, does it fit between the cliffs.
 *
 * The rectangle is the same one `siting.contains_cm` decides membership of on the server:
 * both halves rotate a centred WxD box by one yaw, and `footprintCorners` is the forward
 * direction of the transpose that function applies. They must not drift apart.
