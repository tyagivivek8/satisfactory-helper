 * was ticked. Kept apart from the control that displays them because everything that draws
 * needs this and nothing that draws needs the folds.
 *
 * THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING THAT IMPORTS IT: every drawing module reaches this one, so
 * anything it reached back would be evaluated before all of them. test_architecture.py

 *   FETCH RANK -- `Fetcher.rank` in registry.ts, one number, per wave. WHEN a request goes

 *
 *   ROW RANK -- the `rank` below, three parts, per layer. WHERE a layer's row sits in the
 *   control, which decides nothing but the order of a list of checkboxes.
 *
 * A feature declares both and they are free to disagree: the node dots are fetched first and
 * listed late.
 *
 * ROW RANK IS NOT DRAW ORDER either. Everything clickable shares one canvas, and that canvas
 * draws in the order paths were ADDED to it -- a list Leaflet maintains and this rank appears
 * nowhere in. `sortFunction` below is read by the control when it rebuilds its list and by
 * nothing else, which is why `raiseNodeDots` in markers.ts exists and why no band ordering
 * here could replace it.

 * doubles as the map's legend and its only filter, so its order has to survive a reload --
 * `sortLayers` pins it to the rank each group is given when it is created, rather than to
 * whatever order parallel fetches resolved in.

 * The base map has no row at all: it is the MODE radios at the top of the control, and
 * tiles.ts puts its layer on the map directly.
