/* The page's identity line, and the one dot that is not a thing the player built.

 * `get()` has no dedupe, so one entry per consumer would be two requests for one answer on
 * every autosave. The two consumers meet here instead, and the registry stays one entry per
 * request.
 *
 * `settles: true`: the dimmed map and the "loading…" line are cleared when this reply lands,
 * either way, because this is the reply that replaces the words the switch put there.
