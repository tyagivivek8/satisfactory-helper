/* Where a colour is DECLARED, and where the claim that the colours were chosen against each
 * other is CHECKED.
 *
 * Every value used to be here, on the argument that a table of colours picked against each
 * other only holds together while it is in one place to be compared. Half of that was right,
 * and the half it got wrong is the half that mattered: what has to be in one place is the
 * COMPARISON, not the values. Keeping the values here as well left every measured warrant --
 * "dE 34 from the terrain", "dE 4.5 from the extractors, which is why that one was rejected"
 * -- in a comment no build has ever read, and put the pipe rust and the storage magenta in a
 * different file from the width, the tier ramp and the reasoning that produced them. The file
 * even had to carve out an exception for the two networks that had done it the other way.
 *
 * So the values went to the features and the comparison stayed. Every colour on this page is
 * now declared by the module that draws with it, beside its warrant, through `declareColours`
 * below. This file holds no hex at all, which `test_architecture.py` checks. What it holds
 * instead is the discipline the old header could only describe: hex to CIE Lab, pairwise dE
 * across every pair of colours declared by two DIFFERENT owners, and a console.error in dev
 * mode for any pair under the threshold that is not written down below with a reason and a
 * measured distance.
 *
 * A new layer's colour is still a decision about the whole table. The difference is that the
 * table now answers back.

 *
 * `owner` is the drawing MODULE, not the layer, because that is the line the check needs.
 * Colours are compared across owners and never within one: a step inside a single family is

 * Sharing an owner is what says "these two are meant to look related". Not sharing one is what
 * says "these two must never be confused".
 *
 * There is no registration order to get right. Every module that declares is imported by
 * main.ts, an import graph is evaluated synchronously, and the microtask queued at the FIRST
 * declaration cannot run until that whole graph has finished -- so the audit always sees the
 * complete table, and a feature added tomorrow needs to do nothing but declare.
