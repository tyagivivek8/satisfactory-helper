 *
 * THEIR OWN PANE WOULD NOT WORK: the DOM delivers a click to the topmost element under the

 * below everything already sunk, so the piece sunk LAST ends up at the very bottom. The
 * junction squares go first and the runs after them, which leaves a splitter sitting ON the
 * lines it joins -- a square hidden beneath a line is not CLICKABLE, and the popup naming the
 * piece is the whole reason it has one.

 * restyle above: a pole sunk with the runs would be a mark under every line it terminates and a
 * popup nobody can open. Partitioned on the mark rather than on draw order, because draw order
