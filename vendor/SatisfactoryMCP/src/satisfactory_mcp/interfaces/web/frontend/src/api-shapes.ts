/* What the API sends, under the names the page uses -- one line per shape.
 *
 * THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS THAT IT HAS NO FIELDS IN IT. Every type below resolves to a
 * component of `api-schema.d.ts`, which is generated from the server's own `/openapi.json`;
 * a field spelled here would be a hand-written copy of a generated type.
 *
 * The indirection is what buys the page its own names. `components["schemas"]["…"]` at
 * fifteen call sites would put the generator's addressing scheme into every drawing module,
 * so a converted endpoint would be a rename across all of them; here it is one line in one
 * file. floors.ts predates this and reaches into the schema itself.
