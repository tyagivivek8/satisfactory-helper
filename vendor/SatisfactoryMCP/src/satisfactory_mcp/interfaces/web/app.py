"""The FastAPI application, and the two loaders every endpoint reads the world through.

``create_app`` takes them as arguments so the test suite can run the whole HTTP surface
against the committed fixture projection with no game install and no ``.sav`` on disk. The
default game loader is a copy of ``interfaces.mcp.app``'s rather than an import of it: the
two surfaces are siblings over one domain, and importing would make the stdio server a
dependency of the HTTP server.
