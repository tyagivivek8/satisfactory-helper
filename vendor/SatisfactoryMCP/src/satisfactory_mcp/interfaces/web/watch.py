"""Notice that a save -- or a note written about one -- changed, tell every browser, parse it.

Two trees, because two things move under a player who is using both halves at once: the game
writes ``.sav`` files, and this project writes factory labels and stored plans beside them.
They are published as two SSE event names so the page can refetch the half that moved.

Polling, not a filesystem watch: Satisfactory rewrites an autosave in place and the write is
not atomic, so an inotify-style event fires mid-write and a reader gets a torn file, whereas
a poll of the modification times can only observe the mtime the finished write stamped.
Fan-out is one ``asyncio.Queue`` per subscriber, because a shared queue means the first
browser to read an event is the only one that sees it. The queues are bounded and drop
rather than block: a browser that has stopped reading has gone away, and these are edge
triggers.
