"""``satisfactory-mcp-web`` -- serve the JSON API and the map on localhost.

Bound to 127.0.0.1: the API serves the contents of the player's save directory and applies
no authentication at all, so reaching it from the network must stay a deliberate act.
Uvicorn is handed the import string rather than the object, which is what ``--reload`` and
the worker model need.
