"""The serialisation vocabulary every JSON endpoint speaks, and the three conventions.

* **Metres, one decimal.** The save stores centimetres; every coordinate that leaves this
  layer has been divided by 100 and rounded, exactly as the text presenters do.
* **``?save=`` and ``?world=`` wherever a state is read**, so a page can pin itself to one
  save while the game keeps autosaving over another.
* **An error is ``{"error": "..."}`` with a 4xx**, never a 200 with an empty list: a browser
