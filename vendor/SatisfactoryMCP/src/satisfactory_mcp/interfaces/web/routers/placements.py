"""``/api/machines`` and ``/api/structures``: everything the player physically placed.

Two endpoints and one row builder, because they answer one question in two resolutions. A
machine is an ACTOR -- it has an instance id, a recipe, a clock -- and a foundation is a
lightweight buildable with none of those, interned into a positional table because a record
per piece would be megabytes.

**THE LINE THIS FILE DRAWS, which its neighbours cite:** an ACTOR record always carries a
class, and an INTERNED table row may not. ``machines``/``extractors``/``generators`` are
actor records, written behind ``cls.startswith("Build_")``, so ``cls`` is a non-empty string
and ``building_name`` never falls through to ``None``. ``structures`` is the interned table,
where a class is an INDEX into a legend and the row whose index points past the end is a real
piece at a real place with no name.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.

Wire rules: docs/web-wire.md.

    header, which is why the projection interns them separately as

    Decoded by ``core.saveio.rows``, which is where the guard lives for all ten readers
    of these interned tables: a malformed row costs one piece, not the endpoint.

    **Rotation is carried, as of schema 12**, and this docstring used to say the opposite
    -- the instance transform's quaternion was dropped at extraction and a client could
    only draw these axis-aligned, which is why an angled slab came out of the map as a
    staircase of squares. ``yaw`` is now the fifth column of a row and comes out as a
    ``yaw`` field: degrees about world Z, positive turning +X towards +Y. ``null`` for a
    projection cut before 12, which a client must keep drawing axis-aligned rather than
    reading as zero.

    One thing the projection still does not carry, and it is not invented here:

    * **Per-class size.** None of these classes has clearance data, so ``footprint`` is
      ``None`` for all eighteen of them. They are all built on the same grid instead,
      whose edge ``tile_m`` reports from ``FOUNDATION_M`` so the page does not hardcode 8.

    Positions are piece centres: on the reference save consecutive foundations of one
    slab sit exactly ``tile_m`` apart.

    A world with nothing built answers ``{"structures": [], "count": 0}`` -- an empty
    list is a real answer here, unlike a save that could not be read at all.

    Sent one row per piece, ungrouped. Measured on the reference world -- 8,347 pieces,
    708 KB (610 KB of it before the yaw column) -- which is the same order as
    ``/api/collectibles`` already ships (3,455 rows, 547 KB). Grouping into grid cells would halve a
    payload that is not the bottleneck and would cost the per-piece class the popup and
