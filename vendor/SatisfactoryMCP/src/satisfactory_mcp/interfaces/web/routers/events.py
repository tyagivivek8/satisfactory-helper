"""``/api/events``: the server-sent event stream, and the only route that is not JSON.

The one endpoint that holds a connection open, and the one with no ``?save=``/``?world=``:
it never reads a world, only that world's header. It subscribes to the ``SaveWatcher`` the
app's lifespan starts, through ``request.app.state`` rather than through ``Depends`` -- a
dependency would put a parameter into ``/openapi.json`` for a stream that has no schema.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.
