"""``/api/icons/{desc}``: one item's picture, out of the reader's own game.

A loader and only a loader: an item icon is the game's artwork, this repository ships none
of it, and every answer here is either the file the reader generated or the name of the tool
that would write it. That is why the 404s are long -- they are the whole of the
documentation a reader gets at the moment they need it.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.
This route carries an EXPLICIT id; see ``OPERATION_ICON``.

Wire rules: docs/web-wire.md.

    reader to ignore console errors. The GET keeps its 404 and names the generator.

    with the command that would fill it. A directory that exists without this class is a
    different fact: a few item classes have no picture anywhere in the game's own docs, so
    "no icon for this one" is a complete answer rather than a missing file.
