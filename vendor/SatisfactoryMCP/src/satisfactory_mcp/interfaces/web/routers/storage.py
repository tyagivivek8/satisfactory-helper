"""``/api/storage``: every container and fluid buffer, and what is inside each one.

The endpoint that answers "where did I put the steel" rather than "how much steel have I
got", which is what the projection's inventory totals already answer.

**TWO ROW MODELS, NOT ONE WITH OPTIONAL HALVES.** ``_storage_row`` builds a common prefix
and then ``update``s it with one of two tails: the other side's fields are ABSENT rather
than null, because a container does not have an empty fluid level -- it has no fluid level.
A single TypedDict with ``total=False`` on the tails would describe that and also DESTROY
it: pydantic serialises in declaration order and drops absent keys, so a solid row validated
against a model declaring the fluid tail first comes back with its own five fields RE-KEYED
into the gaps the missing ones left. So each variant is declared whole, in its own emission
order, and ``kind`` is the discriminator a reader branches on.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.

    The nine fields above ``kind`` are the prefix ``_storage_row`` builds first; the five

    shared base with ``StorageFluid``, because inheritance decides field order somewhere
    other than where the emission is.

    ``cls`` and ``name`` are not nullable: a container is an ACTOR record and its class is
    written out. The coordinates ARE nullable, because an actor whose transform did not
    decode has no ``pos``. ``w_m``/``l_m`` are null for the classes the docs dump carries no
    clearance for -- the HUB's built-in container, the Blueprint Designer's, the Dimensional
    Depot uploader -- because a size invented here would arrive looking measured.

    ``slots`` is the inventory component's own slot count forwarded whole, and null rather
    than 0 for a row the projection wrote none for. ``more`` is always 0 from this server,
    which sends every box whole; the field stays because it is the row's own statement that
    nothing was left off, and because a client's "+N more" tile must keep working against a
    server that truncates.
