"""``/api/floors``: the floor decomposition of a world, one storey at a time.

**Nullability is not decoration.** ``_m``, ``_xyz`` and ``_yaw`` all return ``float |
None``, so every field they produce is declared that way even where the reference world has
never produced a null: a response_model is a validator as well as a schema, and a field
declared ``float`` that arrives null is a 500 rather than a null.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.
``floors_view``, not ``floors``, for exactly that reason.

    Nothing in the save says "floor". ``domain.factories.floors`` recovers them from the
    geometry -- 4-connected platforms of 8 m foundation cells, then a per-platform cluster
    of deck heights -- and this endpoint parses the query, calls it once, and rounds.

    **It ships ids, not geometry.** A client already has every machine, splitter, belt and
    pipe from ``/api/machines``, ``/api/structures``, ``/api/belts`` and ``/api/pipes``; the
    one thing it cannot derive is which floor each of them is on. So a band lists
    ``machines`` and ``attachments`` as instance leaves, and a run is keyed by its belt
    ``chain`` or its pipe row position -- the joins those payloads already carry.

    **The runs are grouped by what they do to a floor**, not listed flat:

    * ``same-deck`` -- both ends over one band, and the set a floor filter draws.
    * ``connector`` -- the ends are on two different bands. This is how you leave a floor,
      and it is where the lifts and risers are.
    * ``terrain`` -- neither end is over a deck.
    * ``mixed`` -- one end on a deck, one on the ground.

    **``placements`` is only what did NOT land on a floor**, since what did is listed by id
    inside its own band. The three ways of not being on one: ``exempt`` (a miner stands on a
    resource node and a water extractor on water -- by native class, not by a substring),
    ``terrain`` (measured against the heightfield) and ``off-deck``.

    **``terrain_measured`` says whether the ground was consulted at all.** The 1 m
    heightfield is derived from the reader's own game install and most machines have none,
    in which case nothing can be in the ``terrain`` group and an empty one would otherwise
    read as "nothing is on the ground here".

    ``?factory=`` takes a label the player gave a factory, or any selector the MCP tools
    take; ``?platform=`` takes the index this endpoint hands out, which is stable across
    calls. Either narrows placements and runs to that footprint, including the ones
    underneath it, since "what is under this deck" is part of the question.

    A save too old to carry ``FGLightweightBuildableSubsystem`` is a **200 with a
    ``note``**, not an error and not an empty list: the world has floors, this file cannot
