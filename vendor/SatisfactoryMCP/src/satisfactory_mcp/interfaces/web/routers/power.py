"""``/api/power``: every pole and tower, and the span of every wire between them.

The geometry half of a network whose connectivity the projection has carried since schema
11, and the JOIN is positional: ``wires[i]`` is the span of ``graph["power"][i]``, and this
is the one place the two lists are put back together.

A pole is an interned table row, so its ``cls`` is an index into a legend and
``saveio.rows`` answers ``None`` for an index past the end -- and its ``name`` with it,
because ``building_name`` is None in, None out. Its COORDINATES are the other way round:
``iter_power_poles`` drops a row whose class index or position will not read.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.

Wire rules: docs/web-wire.md.
