"""The base map: a user-supplied render, and the tile pyramids cut from it.

Everything here is a LOADER. Nothing in this repository ships a picture of this world, so
every route answers either "here is the file you generated" or "here is the exact tool that
would write it" -- which is why the 404s are long: they are the whole of the documentation a
reader gets at the moment they need it.

Three layers, one grid. ``map`` is the game's own artwork under ``local/tiles/``; ``terrain``
and ``satellite`` are renders drawn from the 1 m heightfield under ``local/renders/<layer>/``.
Every one is cut on the same frame at the same tile size into the same ``{z}/{x}_{y}.png``,
so switching layers is switching a directory. The names and the layout are
``core.gameassets.pyramid``'s, imported rather than retyped; what this side owns is the
bounds check, because only a server has requests to refuse.

WARNING: the function names are the operation_ids -- renaming one churns the committed
schema. These three routes carry EXPLICIT ids; see ``OPERATION_MAPIMAGE``.
