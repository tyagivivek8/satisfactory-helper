    of things standing nearby. They stay apart all the way out to the page: a node rests on
    terrain, a foundation is wherever the player put it, and one median over the three would
    be a number describing none of them. ``terrain_source`` says which layer of the field
    answered and ``terrain_accuracy_m`` what the generator measured for that layer, because
    a 0.2 m landscape texel and a 3.9 m fill texel are not the same claim.

    0: zero fill is a real and different measurement. ``terrain_note`` does the same job for
    the field, whose two causes are no field on this machine and a coordinate the field has
    no data for.

    ``terrain_water_m`` is the water surface's own height, which the channel takes from a
    cooked water volume's bounding box and knows to centimetres wherever there is water at
    all. ``terrain_water_depth_m`` is that minus the ground, and only exists where the ground
    under the water was itself measured at 1 m -- over the fill layer, which is most of the

    **A failed save is not a failed answer.** The node table is static, covers the whole map
    and needs no ``.sav`` at all, so a world whose save will not load still gets its region,
    its ground elevation and its nearest nodes; what it loses is the built population and
    the occupancy join, and ``save_error`` says so rather than letting "no extractor here"
    quietly mean "no save here".

    **It prefers the extracted terrain where there is any.** On a machine that has run
    ``tools/gen_world_heightmap.py``, the 1 m field answers "how high is it here" with one
    number at the coordinate asked about instead of a population of things standing near it.
    Where there is no field, or the field has no data there, the population answers.

    Not cached: the probe is a few milliseconds over the whole reference world, so a
    per-(world, save) cache would buy an invalidation bug. The heightfield itself is cached
