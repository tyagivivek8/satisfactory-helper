"""``/api/factories``: the names the player gave, and the proposals for the rest.

The two halves are one question: a proposal whose machines the player has already named is
not a proposal, so the named set is built before the proposed one is filtered against it.

**The boxes are tuples, not lists.** ``centroid_m`` is exactly two numbers and ``bbox_m``
exactly four, so pydantic emits ``prefixItems`` and typegen turns them into
``[number, number]`` and ``[number, number, number, number]``, which the page indexes
without a length guard. Declared ``list[float]`` they would arrive as ``number[]``.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.

Wire rules: docs/web-wire.md.
