    ``x_m``/``y_m``/``z_m`` are not nullable even though ``_xyz`` can answer nulls: that
    helper also serves placements, whose transforms can fail to decode, and a node has no
    transform to fail -- the triple comes from the static table, three floats per node.

    ``occupant_cls`` and ``occupant_name`` are nullable because the occupancy join resolves
    only the extractors whose target is a node key. ``region`` is null for the handful of
    nodes the raster calls void.

    ``resource`` is the class id, which is what the layer keys and the colour table are keyed
    by; ``resource_name`` is the word a reader reads, and is the same word the MCP tools use.

    ``reachable`` is false for a node no unlocked extractor can work -- the state the text
    surface prints as ``LOCKED`` and excludes from free capacity. It is null, never true, when
    the save could not be read: reachability is a fact about what this world has researched,
    and with no world there is nothing to have researched it.

    The join is partial and says so: ``occupancy`` resolves only the extractors whose target
    is a node key, so ``occupied`` false means "no extractor known here", never "free". The
    popup carries the node id, which doubles as a ``node:`` selector for the MCP tools.

    The region name is joined on this side because the raster is: sending 608 rows and then
    the grid for the page to index into would put the orientation trap (row 0 is the north
    edge) in two places. It is ``null`` for a node the raster calls void.

    **A free node is not always a usable one.** ``reachable`` is the same test the text
    surface marks ``LOCKED`` and leaves out of free capacity -- a resource well satellite
    with no Pressurizer researched is not somewhere a plan can go.

    **A failed save is not a failed answer.** The node table is static and needs no ``.sav``,
    so a world whose save will not load still gets its geography; what it loses is the
    occupancy join and the unlock set, and ``save_error`` says so with ``occupied`` and every
    row's ``reachable`` null beside it.
