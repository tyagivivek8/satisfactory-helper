"""``/api/belts`` and ``/api/pipes``: the two routed networks, as built.

One file for two endpoints, because ``_curve_m`` is one translation that both call and
nothing else does: a bend read one way here and another way there is the failure mode a
shared helper exists to make impossible. Named ``routes_layer`` rather than ``routes``,
which under a package of FastAPI routers would read as the framework's own endpoint table.

A belt piece and a pipe piece are INTERNED table rows -- their class is an index into a
legend and ``saveio.rows`` answers ``None`` for an index past the end -- so ``BeltRow.cls``
and ``PipeRow.cls`` are nullable, and so are the ``name``s ``building_name`` renders from
them. An ATTACHMENT is an ordinary actor record, so ``AttachmentRow.cls`` is a string.

WARNING: the function names are the operation_ids -- renaming one churns the committed
schema.

#: A point on a route, ``[x, y, z]`` in game metres.
#:
#: A tuple rather than ``list[float]``, the only way a schema can say "exactly three":
#: typegen turns it into a ``[number, number, number]`` the page indexes without a length
#: guard. Not nullable in any position -- ``rows._points`` drops a point whose x, y or z
#: will not read as a number.
Point3M = tuple[float, float, float]

#: The tangents that bend ONE span of a route, ``[leave, arrive]`` in game metres.
#:
#: ``leave`` is the tangent leaving the point behind the span and ``arrive`` the one arriving
#: at the point ahead of it -- the pair a cubic Hermite between those two points takes. They
#: are displacements in the same space as the points, so whatever transform a client applies
#: to a point applies to these unchanged, including the y-flip that draws the map.
SpanCurveM = tuple[Point3M, Point3M]

#: A route's curve, one entry per span, in step with ``points_m``. **Nullable at two levels
#: and they mean different things.** ``null`` in a SLOT: that span is straight and is drawn
#: as the line it already was. ``null`` for the WHOLE field: the route has no bend anywhere
#: in it, or the projection predates the column -- both of which mean the same thing to a
#: client, which is why ``_curve_m`` spells them the same way.

    The belts' other half, and the same shape one layer down.

    **Each pipe says which fluid it carries**, which is the thing a belt cannot say: the game
    keeps an ``FGPipeNetwork`` per connected plumbing system with the fluid on it and its
    members listed, so ``fluid`` is the world's own answer rather than an inference from what
    the pipe is plugged into.

    **``direction`` is INFERRED, and ``basis`` says from what.** Nothing on a pipe records
    which way the fluid goes, and the points are in the order the file stores them. But the
    plumbing AROUND it records a great deal: the save serialises every fluid coupling and
    names a machine's port ``PipeInputFactory`` or ``PipeOutputFactory``.
    ``domain/world/flow.py`` reads that graph and declines wherever more than one answer is
    consistent. So ``direction`` is ``forward`` along ``points_m``, ``reverse`` against it,
    or ``unknown``, and ``basis`` is one of:

    * ``machine port`` -- this very pipe ends at a port the save TYPES. Barely an inference.
    * ``pump`` -- a pump or valve at one end, one-way by construction.
    * ``propagated`` -- only the shape of the wider network settles it.
    * ``unresolved`` -- and then ``direction`` is ``unknown``. A pipe in a loop, or a trunk
      with producers and consumers on both sides, genuinely has no fixed direction.

    A client may draw an arrow on the first three and must not on the fourth.

    **``curve_m`` rides here too, on exactly the belts' terms.** Pipes are straight runs and
    elbows, and the six points of an elbow are its corners rather than its curve: an elbow
    drawn from the points alone is the polygon cutting the corner it was built to round.

    Not in here: pumps, junctions, valves and fluid buffers. They carry no spline at all,
