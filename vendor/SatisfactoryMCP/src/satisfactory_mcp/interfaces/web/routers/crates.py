"""``/api/crates``: the death and dismantle crates on the ground, and what is in each one.

A crate is an event rather than a place: it exists only from the moment somebody died or
dismantled with a full inventory until the moment it is emptied, which is why these rows
are not among the containers ``/api/storage`` lists.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- renaming it churns the committed schema.
