"""A JSON + map interface over the same domain services the MCP tools call.

Importing this package must not require ``fastapi`` or ``uvicorn``: they live in the
optional ``web`` extra, so only ``app``, ``routers``, ``serial``, ``watch`` and ``__main__``
touch the ASGI stack, and nothing outside ``interfaces/`` may import any of them. This
package never imports ``interfaces.mcp`` either: the two adapters share the domain, not each
other. ``tests/test_architecture.py`` checks all of it.
