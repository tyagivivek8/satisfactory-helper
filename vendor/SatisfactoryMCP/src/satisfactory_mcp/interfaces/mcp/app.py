"""The MCP app object, and the state accessors every tool group needs.

Split out so tool modules can register against one ``mcp`` without importing each other.
``server`` imports the tool packages purely for their decorator side effects.

The shared resolvers now live with their domains -- ``domain.factories.resolve`` and
``domain.spatial.origin`` -- and are re-bound here only so the old private names keep
resolving for the tool modules that spell them.
