    The web map has drawn these all along; this is the text answer to "is there a pipe

    run is one belt CHAIN (consecutive conveyor pieces, split at splitters, mergers and

    with what stands there where known, the drawn length, and the elevation span.

    what it ends on. A network is one connected plumbing system, so that is the view
    that tells you which system a run belongs to; `radius_m` and `to` do not narrow it,
    and the distance column places each network relative to `near`.

    `near` and `to` accept a coordinate in metres, `me`, a named factory, or one of this
    tool's own run ids -- `chain:7`, `pipe:333` -- which centres on that run's midpoint,

    set, only runs passing within both radii are listed. Proximity is measured against
    the runs' drawn lines, not their corner points, so a run crossing mid-span counts.

    Long lists page with `offset=`, and the truncation line names the next offset --
    a busy junction can carry hundreds of chains and the tail of that list is as real

    - **nearest** lists one row per node ranked by DISTANCE from `near`, with the
      distance shown -- "what is closest". Requires `near`.

    `sources` is a list of selectors; locations union, filters intersect::

        ["north"]                          northern half of the map
        ["region:Northern Forest"]         one named region

        ["north", "resource:Crude Oil"]    crude oil in the north
        ["bbox:-500,-2500,600,-1800"]      a rectangle, metres

    `near` accepts a coordinate in metres, `me` for the player, or the name of a
    labelled factory -- "the nearest free coal to the coal powerplant" needs no
    coordinates. Giving `near` in any mode adds a distance column.

    All three modes page with `offset=`; the ranking is stable, so the tail of 127 iron
    nodes is reachable 25 at a time.

    **Water is the exception to everything above.** Open water carries no node, so asking

    the reader's own save -- their machines, their belts, their siting. The
    satisfactory-calculator.com one opens a third-party map of the vanilla world, which
    knows the terrain and the nodes and nothing the player built.

    `target` accepts a coordinate in metres, `me`, one of your named factories, a node
    id from `search_resource_nodes`, a resource name — the last centres on that
    resource's nodes and switches its overlays on — `slab:<n>` for a platform from
    `factory_map show=slabs`, `chain:<n>`/`pipe:<n>` for a run from `search_conduits`,
    or `plan:<name>` for a plan that has a recorded siting (see site_plan).

    Only the Crude Oil layer tokens are confirmed; the rest follow the same pattern and
    are flagged. A wrong token still opens the map in the right place, just without that
    overlay.
