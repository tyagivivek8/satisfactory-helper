"""Hard-drive research: what is waiting to be picked, and which option to take.

Split from ``planning`` because the question is different in kind. The optimiser sizes a
factory you have decided to build; this ranks a one-off choice against the factory you
already have.

**The choice is not irreversible, and saying it was made this advice worse.** Confirmed by
the player in-game (2026-07-28), closing OQ2: the option you do NOT take **returns to the
pool** and can be offered by a later drive. Only the drive is spent, never the schematic.

That inverts the advice. Picking is low-stakes, so the right move is to take whatever helps
the factory you have now and let the other alternate come back around -- there is nothing
to agonise over and no reason to hoard an unclaimed drive waiting for a better roll. The
old framing ("irreversible") argued for exactly the opposite behaviour.
