    """Optimise a factory with an LP over this world's unlocked recipes.

    ``sources`` says which resource nodes may feed the plan, as a list of selectors --
    named regions, radii, grid cells, compass directions, or specific node ids::

        ["north"]                        everything in the northern half
        ["region:Northern Forest"]       one named region
        ["near:0,-2000,900"]             within 900 m of (0, -2000) metres
        ["node:BP_ResourceNode30_103"]   one exact node (repeatable)
        ["grid:X3Y4", "grid:X3Y5"]       specific grid cells
        ["north", "resource:Crude Oil"]  narrow a location to one resource

    Omit it and the whole map is in scope. Use search_resource_nodes to discover ids.

    Machine counts are whole buildings at a derived clock: a 52.8 machine-equivalent
    result is reported as 53 machines at 99.6%. That is exact, always a clean ratio,
    and provably the power-optimal way to run that throughput, so ordinary ratio
    underclocking is automatic and needs no parameter.

    ``extractor_clocks`` overclocks the SOURCE NODES only, e.g. [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5].
    That is the usual play: a node set is fixed, so speed is the only way to get more
    out of it, whereas overclocking production machines mostly burns power. Each
    machine above 100% needs Power Shards, which nothing here counts.

    ``clocks`` is only for asking a different question: passing [0.5, 1.0] lets the
    solver SPREAD throughput over more machines to save power, which is real but not
    free, so each machine is priced at ``machine_cost_mw`` (default 5 MW, just above
    the 2.58 MW/machine that trade was measured to be worth). Overclock modes are not
    offered by default because they consume Power Shards, which nothing here counts.

    objective: max_mw | max_item | min_raw | min_machines | min_power.
    Every item is balanced as an EQUALITY, so a byproduct with no consumer makes the
    plan infeasible rather than silently vanishing.

    ``exports`` is the whitelist of what may leave, and the single most load-bearing
    argument here; default is power only, which is often infeasible for crude oil::

        exports=["MW"]                        power out, plant must be self-powered
        exports=["Plastic", "Rubber"]         items out, NO power export
        exports=["MW", "Plastic", "Rubber"]   both -- MW must be listed explicitly

    Two things worth reading twice. The power token is **MW** (``mw``, ``power`` and
    ``Power`` all work too), not the item name of anything. And ``exports``
    **replaces** the default rather than extending it: naming an item drops MW, which
    is deliberate, because exporting MW also forbids drawing from the existing grid.
    A token matching no item is refused by name rather than solved around.

    ``sloops`` is a BUDGET, not a switch: it is how many Somersloops you will actually
    commit, and the solver spends up to that many wherever they buy the most. Default 0
    spends none, because only a fixed number exist on the whole map and a plan that
    quietly assumed them would be unbuildable. Each one costs 4x power for 2x output on
    its machine, so they are placed one at a time across many machines rather than
    filling one -- output is linear in sloops and power is quadratic, so spreading wins.

    ``logistics_items`` pins named items into the belt/pipe table however small their
    flow, as rows ADDED to the ``limit`` biggest by volume. Without it, a two-item
    question can fall off the bottom of a big plan's flow table.

    ``site_at`` says where the plan will STAND. On its own it makes the plan's water
    assumption MEASURED rather than assumed: the terrain at that pad is read and the note
    quotes how much of it is under water, at what level, and how far below the dry ground.
    It never changes a number the LP produced -- how many extractors a body of water holds
    is placement geometry no data here carries. With ``save_as`` it is also recorded, with
    yaw and footprint, so later calls can answer "does what stands there match it"
    (diff_vs_save) and "show me" (show_on_map target='plan:<name>'); a recalled plan that
    was sited is measured at its own site without being told again. Use site_plan to set or
    move the siting of an already-stored plan.

    recipe), a generator on its building alone since its fuel is piped in rather than
    set on the machine, an extractor on the node it occupies. A Refinery running some
    other recipe is busy, not spare, so it never counts toward the plan.
