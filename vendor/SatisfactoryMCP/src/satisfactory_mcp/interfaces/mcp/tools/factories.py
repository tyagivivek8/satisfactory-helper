    """Measured uptime per machine, and WHY each stopped one is stopped.

    The only measured numbers in this MCP. Every manufacturing building keeps a fixed
    300-second productivity window; uptime is seconds-producing over that window.

    States, worst first: `paused`, `dead node` (extractor bound to no resource --
    a game update removed it), `no recipe`, `blocked` (output stack full),
    `starved` (input empty), `stalled` (has input, output has room, still not running),
    `intermittent`, `saturated`, `unmonitored`.

    A stalled machine that no wire reaches says so in its `cause`, and every machine wired
    to nothing is named in a note whatever state it is in. The save records no "has power"
    flag, so a machine that IS wired is never called unpowered here -- the wire is the only
    electrical fact the file carries.

    For a STARVED machine it also says what physically feeds the input it lacks: the run
    that arrives, what stands at its far end and that feeder's own state, ONE hop back --
    `trace_upstream` walks the rest. "No conduit of that medium arrives" and "one arrives
    and the save joins its far end to nothing" are different rows and are never merged.

    A missing FLUID is diagnosed on the plumbing manual's own ladder -- (1) connection,
    (2) head lift, (3) flow rate -- and the `cause` names the FIRST rung that fires, so a
    line that cannot climb to the machine is never answered with its supply rates. Solids
    have no head-lift rung and read exactly as before.

    **Blocked is not automatically a fault.** A base whose output nobody consumes fills
    its buffers and stops, which is what a mature factory at rest looks like. Starved,
    stalled and no-recipe are the actionable ones.

    The sweep over every factory also reports three plumbing faults that belong to no machine
    set: fluid buffers holding too little to output at their intake rate, pipeline pumps no
    wire reaches, and points where a line climbs above the head lift pushing it. All three
    are world-wide there, not scoped to a factory.

    `offset` pages every table in the answer at once, worst first throughout.
