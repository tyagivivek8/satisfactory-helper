"""One computation per key, however many callers ask for it at once.

Two reads in this tree cost seconds and are asked for by eleven callers at a time, because
that is how many layers the map page fetches: the save parse (a subprocess, ~3.7 s) and the
derived views over the projection it returns (~0.8 s). Both are pure functions of their key,
so the second concurrent caller has nothing to add and waits for the first one's answer.
