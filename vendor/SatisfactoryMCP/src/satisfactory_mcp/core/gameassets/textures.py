"""What a cooked texture's bytes are: how long the mip chain is, and the blocks unpacked.

**The file's length is the integrity check.** A mip chain is stored largest-first with nothing
between the levels, so its total is arithmetic: a ``.ubulk`` of any other length was re-cooked,
i.e. the game changed, and is not decoded on a guess. :func:`inline_chain_side` is that check
for a texture with no ``.ubulk``, whose levels are ``BulkDataMap`` entries in the ``.uasset``.

All three decoders below hand back **BGRA**, so Pillow is told ``"raw", "BGRA"``; read as
``"RGBA"`` the picture survives a glance with red and blue swapped. ``texture2ddecoder`` and
Pillow arrive as arguments, so a machine without the ``gen`` extra still imports this module.
