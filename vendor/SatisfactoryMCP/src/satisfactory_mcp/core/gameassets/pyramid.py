"""The tile pyramid: one sheet at one resolution per zoom, and renamed into place whole.

Every base layer this project draws is cut into ``{z}/{x}_{y}.png``, one level per zoom, so
the page fetches the pixels it can show rather than a 16384 px sheet. Level ``z`` holds
``2**z`` tiles a side and is **one Lanczos downscale of the whole sheet**, never of the level
above it, so no level accumulates the softening of six successive halvings; the levels below
the top add a third again to the top's own bytes. A pyramid is only ever renamed into place,
so a reader meets a whole tree or no tree. Pillow and the sheet are parameters, as everywhere
in this package, so the suite drives the cutting with a stand-in.

``tiles@2x/`` is the identical GRID at twice the pixels -- same squares of the world, 512 px
a tile -- which is what a hi-DPI display wants from the same ``{z}/{x}/{y}`` request. A 512 px
tile eats a level of depth, so an @2x tree is always exactly one level shallower than the 1x
tree cut from the same sheet.

Above one worker, the per-tile PNG encode is spread over processes and **the resampling stays
serial in the parent**: the level's pixels are published once into a ``shared_memory`` block
and each task crops one row of tiles out of it. Because no worker resamples, none can disagree
about a filter tap at a strip boundary, which is what makes the parallel path byte-identical
rather than merely equivalent -- ``tools/gen_map_renders.py --check-parallel`` compares the
SHA-256 of every tile from both.
