"""The container: a read-only UE5 IoStore reader, enough of one to get ``.umap`` bytes out.

A ``.utoc`` is the table of contents and the ``.ucas`` beside it is the blob; together they
are how UE 5 ships a cooked game. This reads them and never writes one. It was the opening
section of ``tools/gen_world_collectibles.py``, which the three other generators reached by
importing that file by path.

**The Oodle decompressor is a parameter.** Container blocks are Oodle-compressed and the
only decompressor available is ``ooz``, from the ``gen`` extra -- so ``IoStore`` takes the
callable rather than importing it, which is what lets this module be imported (and driven by
the test suite with a stand-in) on a machine that has no such package installed.
``oodle_decompress`` below is the real one, ready to be handed in, and it does its import
inside the call.
