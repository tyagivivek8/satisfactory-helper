"""The game's own map areas: a 4096x4096 raster, and what each palette index is called.

``/Game/FactoryGame/Interface/UI/Minimap/MapAreaPersistenLevel/MapareatexturePersistentLevel``
is an ``FGMapAreaTexture``. It carries ``mDataWidth`` 4096, ``mAreaData`` -- 4096x4096 palette
indices, row 0 north -- and ``mColorToArea``, one entry per index naming the ``UFGMapArea``
object that index means and the bounding box of its extent in texels. This is the game's own
biome geometry: exact polygon boundaries rasterised at 1.83 m, not an approximation of them.

**A palette index resolves to one area by ``PublicExportHash``, never by package name.** This
build ships thirty-five ``Area_*`` assets under eighteen package names -- ``Area_RedJungle_1``
and ``Area_RedJungle_2`` are both ``.../Area_RedJungle`` -- and such a pair does not always
mean one place: the two ``Area_crater`` assets carry different display names. The hash is
unique across the container, so :meth:`PackageView.import_export_hash` against an asset's own
export map says exactly which file.

**The names are the game's own.** Each asset's default object carries ``mDisplayName``, an
``FText`` whose history is a string-table reference, and the KEY is what is read here --
``Area_Savanna_1`` announcing ``Locations/RockyDesert`` is the game saying those two areas are
one named region. The localised string it points at lives in ``AllStringTables.locres``, which
this reader does not open.

Nothing here is artwork: the raster is palette indices, the areas are identifiers, and
``mColorPalette`` is decoded only for the record -- it is a minimap legend of flat primaries.
