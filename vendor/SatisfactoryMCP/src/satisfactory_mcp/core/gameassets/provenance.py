"""Which build an artifact was cut from, and writing it so it can never say the wrong one.

Every table and raster under ``data/`` derives from one installed build, and a pinned artifact
announces drift rather than answering silently wrong. That needs three things: read the build
the machine has installed, read the build an artifact on disk claims, and install a new one all
at once -- a directory holding this build's rasters beside last build's sidecar does not fail,
it answers.

The game states its build twice and both are kept. :func:`installed_build` reads the JSON the
build system wrote beside the executable and is the pin every staleness guard compares;
:func:`installed_build_from_exe` reads the engine's own literal out of the binary, which is
what a reader can check against their own install without trusting this file's formatting.
