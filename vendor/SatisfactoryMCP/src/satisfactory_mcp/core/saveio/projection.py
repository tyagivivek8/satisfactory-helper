#: Bumped whenever the projection's shape changes, and part of the disk cache key below, so
#: every pickle written by an older schema misses rather than being served without its new
#: fields. A CORRECTING bump matters more than an additive one: an old pickle then disagrees
#: with this code rather than merely being thinner than it.
#: 12 added placement yaw and belt splines.
#: 13 added fluid pipe splines and the belt attachments -- the splitters and mergers a run
#: passes through.
#: 14 added a pipe segment's own actor index, which joins the drawn pipe to the connection
#: graph in ``graph["material"]`` and is what lets flow direction be inferred.
#: 15 added the spline tangents to both route keys, so a curved belt or a pipe elbow draws as
#: the curve it was built as, and a ``storage`` key -- the containers and fluid buffers, with
#: what is in each one.
#: 16 CORRECTS: ``inventories`` had bucketed eight containers' contents as unspendable machine
#: buffers, and a placement whose rotation would not read had claimed to be axis-aligned
#: instead of saying nothing.
#: 17 added ``power`` -- the poles, and the endpoints of every wire between them. Geometry
#: only: the connectivity has been in ``graph["power"]`` since schema 11, so ``wires[i]`` is
#: the span of ``graph["power"][i]`` rather than a second copy of who is wired to whom.
#: 18 added ``crates`` -- the death and dismantle crates lying on the ground, and what is in
#: each one. Its own key rather than more ``storage`` rows, because a container is
#: infrastructure the player built and a crate is a situation the player got into.
#: 19 CORRECTS the key 16 did: a crate's contents had counted into ``inventories["machine"]``,
#: filed with the smelter buffers as material that cannot be spent, and they are recoverable
#: stock, so they move to their own ``inventories["crate"]`` bucket.
#: 20 added a fourth column to a belt segment, the index of its own actor in
#: ``graph["actors"]`` -- the join schema 14 gave a pipe, now given to the conveyor beside it,
#: which is what lets a contracted run be NAMED rather than only described by its far end.
