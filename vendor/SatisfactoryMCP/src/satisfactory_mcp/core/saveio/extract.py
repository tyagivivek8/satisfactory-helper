"""Save-file extractor. Runs as a SEPARATE PROCESS from the MCP server.

    python -m satisfactory_mcp.core.saveio.extract <path-to-sav> [--header-only]

Emits a JSON projection on stdout; diagnostics go to stderr so stdout stays clean. A
subprocess because the parser hard-fails on an unrecognised saveVersion and because a torn
autosave -- the file is rewritten in place every ~5 min while playing -- must not take the
server down, and because the projection is small enough to BE the test fixture, so the whole
suite runs with no game install and no 2.9 MB .sav in git. This module and not ``pioneersav``
owns the schema: the parser answers "what does this file say" and this answers "what does the
MCP server need", and it is the only place in the tree allowed to import a parser at all.

Property-access hazards handled here, all of which fail SILENTLY otherwise:
  * ComponentHeader has no typePath attribute at all.
  * BoolProperty is a raw uint8 where 16 means True (observed 16/1/0).
  * UE omits empty TArray SaveGame properties, so absent means empty, not missing.
  * ObjectReference defines __str__ but not __repr__, so any repr()-based search
    finds nothing.
  * mItemsPickedUp is a MapProperty keyed by player state containing an inner map.

There is one parser: ``pioneersav``. See the comment above the import.

# What that diff said at the moment the library was removed: the two agreed on **every
# projection key, leaf for leaf, on all 31 saves the vendored parser could read**. It can never
# be run again, so it is banked in `tests/fixtures/vendor_parity.json` as a per-save, per-key

#: dismantle crate are the same actor with a different ``mCrateType``, so the KIND is read off
#: a property rather than off a name.
#:
#: NOT the item pickups beside them. ``FGItemPickup_Spawnable`` and

#: business; a crate did not exist until the player made it exist, by dying or by dismantling
#: something with a full inventory.
CRATE_CLASSES = ("BP_Crate_C",)

#: ``EFGCrateType`` (``FGCrate.h``) as the projection spells it: the enum's own three values,
#: renamed only by dropping the ``CT_`` and lowercasing.
#:
#: ``none`` is the game's OWN third value and not a parse failure. ``mCrateType`` is a
#: ``SaveGame`` property, so UE omits it while it sits at the class default of ``CT_None``,
#: and a crate built before the game distinguished death from dismantle carries no type and
#: never will -- the property appears in no save below build 433351, and crates created under
#: builds 201717 and 186638 still read ``none`` under 495413. "Unknown kind" is therefore a

#:
#: The Power Switch, Priority Power Switch and Power Storage are absent because no save here
#: contains one, so nothing can say what a connector offset or a glyph for it would be. Their

      exactly, and the ``Build_`` actors that do not are parts mounted on a wall -- flow
      indicators, ceiling attachments, wall poles -- never a machine. So one yaw is the whole

    * Positive yaw turns +X towards +Y, in the same coordinates the projection's ``pos``

    The general form is kept even though ``x == y == 0`` reduces it to ``2*atan2(z, w)``,

    bend the save does record.

    A Hermite span is ``Q(t) = h00 p0 + h10 m0 + h01 p1 + h11 m1``. Split both tangents into
    the part along the chord ``v = p1 - p0`` and the part across it; the curve's distance from
    the chord SEGMENT is at most its sideways offset plus however far it runs off either end:

    * Sideways is ``h10 m0_perp + h11 m1_perp``, and both basis functions peak at 4/27, so it
      never exceeds ``(4/27)(|m0_perp| + |m1_perp|)``. A bound, not an equality: the two peak
      at different ``t`` (1/3 and 2/3) and partly cancel.
    * Along is the cubic ``u(t) = (s0+s1-2) t^3 + (3-2 s0-s1) t^2 + s0 t``, where ``s`` is a
      tangent's chord-relative length, and it is solved EXACTLY -- ``u`` runs 0 to 1 and any
      excursion outside that is a real overshoot past an endpoint. Exactly, because the crude
      bound reads 7% of the chord for the game's commonest tangent (half the chord) where the
      true overshoot is zero, which would cost the whole optimisation.

    and ``actor_ix`` is the connectivity graph's ``{shortName: index}``, read only.

    Belts are not lightweight buildables and their geometry is in no property: it lives in
    ``FGConveyorChainActor``'s trailing bytes, which ``pioneersav.trailers`` decodes as
    ``location, arrive tangent, leave tangent`` per point.

    Rows are ``[chainIndex, classIndex, [[x, y, z], ...], actorIndex]``, and
    ``[..., tangents]`` where the run bends -- see `_spans` for the fifth column. The layout
    is the one `_pipes` writes, column for column, because the two tables answer the same
    questions and a reader that has to remember which of them puts the actor where is a
    reader that will one day put it in the wrong place.

    * **chainIndex** groups segments into the run the game itself groups them into: one chain
      is one continuous flow of items. Dense and ordered, so a consumer wanting per-chain
      polylines concatenates the rows sharing an index and one wanting per-belt polylines
      draws each row.
    * **classIndex** interns the belt's class, which carries both the mark and whether the
      piece is a belt or a LIFT. A floor view needs exactly that distinction, because a lift
      is the connector between two Z bands.
    * The points are the spline's control points at the whole-centimetre precision
      ``_structures`` uses. There is nothing to thin: they are already the bends.
    * **actorIndex** points into ``graph["actors"]``. Schema 20, and the column that makes a
      drawn chain and a contracted run the same object -- see §6.15,
      ``docs/save-projection.md``, for the four surfaces that were naming the wrong thing
      without it. The chain names its pieces by INSTANCE, which is the very name the graph
      interns, so the join is the save's own identity and not a nearest match.

    Two measured facts about the source that this function is entirely about.

    1. **The spline is in the chain actor's frame**, so the actor's own position has to be
       added back -- the raw points sit a whole map away from the belts they belong to. Every
       chain on this disk carries an identity rotation, so there is no orientation to undo; a
       chain that ever carried one would need the points rotated before translating.
    2. **Segments are stored output-first.** Offsets grow towards the output and
       ``segments[-1]`` holds offset 0, the chain's input, so rows come out reversed and in
       TRAVEL ORDER. In file order consecutive segments of one chain do not meet, and every
       chain draws as a zigzag.

    A chain whose trailing bytes will not decode costs that chain and is counted into
    ``warnings`` rather than the whole projection. The first few also name their exception on
    stderr, because the TYPE of the failure is what says whether the format moved and a count
    cannot carry it.

    ``networks`` is ``[(mPipeNetworkID, fluidClass, [memberPath, ...]), ...]``, and
    ``actor_ix`` is the connectivity graph's ``{shortName: index}``, read only.

    Unlike a belt, a pipe's spline is a PROPERTY: ``mSplineData``, an array of structs whose
    ``Location`` is one control point and whose ``ArriveTangent``/``LeaveTangent`` are the
    curve through them. The points are only the corners of an elbow, so dropping the tangents
    draws the polygon that cuts the corner the pipe was built to round; see `_spans`.

    Rows are ``[networkIndex, classIndex, [[x, y, z], ...], actorIndex]``, and
    ``[..., tangents]`` where the pipe bends:

    * **networkIndex** points into ``networks``, ``[{"id": ..., "fluid": ...}, ...]`` -- the
      game's own ``FGPipeNetwork`` grouping, and the reason this key can say WATER or CRUDE
      OIL rather than only "a pipe". ``-1`` for a pipe no network claims.
    * **classIndex** interns the build class: Mk1 and Mk2, each with a ``NoIndicator``
      variant, which is a pipe whose flow indicator the player switched off.
    * The points are whole centimetres, like ``_belts``, and are already only the corners.
    * **actorIndex** points into ``graph["actors"]``. Schema 14.

    The frame is the actor's, TRANSLATED AND NOT ROTATED: every ``Location`` is relative to
    the pipe's own actor position, and every pipeline actor on this disk carries an identity
    quaternion, so a pipe that ever carried a rotation would need its points rotated before
    translating. The same statement `_belts` makes about chains.

    Flow direction is NOT on a pipe and this file does not invent one. Its two connectors are
    named ``PipelineConnection0`` and ``PipelineConnection1`` rather than input and output,
    ``mFluidBox`` is a single float of contents, and the spline's order is the order the
    player dragged it. What the save does state is the coupling graph -- every fluid
    connection is a component carrying ``mConnectedComponent``, folded into
    ``graph["material"]``, with the component's own name typing the port at a machine
    (``PipeInputFactory``, ``PipeOutputFactory``, ``ConnectionAny0``) -- and ``actorIndex`` is
    the join from a segment row to it. Direction is inferred a layer up, in
    ``domain/world/flow.py``, where the guesswork can be labelled and refused.

    ``PipelineConnection0`` is ``points[0]`` and ``PipelineConnection1`` is ``points[-1]``,
    established by measuring claimed endpoints against their couplings.

    Returns ``(power_edges, power)``, and returning both is the design: ``graph["power"]``
    has carried the power edges as interned actor-index pairs since schema 11, and schema 17
    adds where those edges are DRAWN. Two functions building two lists from the same dict
    would be two chances to skip a different wire and leave the reader joining lists that no
    longer line up. So there is one pass and one rule::

        len(power["wires"]) == len(graph["power"])
        power["wires"][i] is the span of graph["power"][i]

    always, on every save. ``wires[i]`` is ``[x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1]`` in world centimetres
    or **null** where that wire published no geometry -- a torn ``mWireInstances``, or a save
    older than the property, in which case every row is null and the invariant still holds.
    An empty ``wires`` list therefore means "no power edges at all", never "no geometry".

    The geometry is not the two actors' positions, because a wire is strung between
    CONNECTORS and a connector sits at a fixed offset on its owner -- 7 m above a Mk1 pole's
    origin, 2.1 m forward and 4.7 m to one side of a constructor's centre. Drawing
    pole-origin to machine-origin would put every wire through the middle of the machine it
    feeds, so `_wire_span` reads the endpoints the save publishes.

    The pair is ORDERED TO MATCH THE EDGE by measurement, because the save's own order agrees
    with the edge's about half the time: each end is assigned to the nearer of the two actors,
    in plan, which collapses the endpoint-to-origin offset to a per-class constant. Where the
    two are equidistant the save's order is kept, there being nothing to measure.

    Poles are the other half, a plain interned table in the shape ``structures`` uses:
    ``[classIndex, x, y, z, yaw, actorIndex]``, whole centimetres. The sixth column is the
    pole's index in ``graph["actors"]``, the join schema 14 gave a pipe, and is what lets a
    reader count a pole's wires off the edge list rather than off a second copy of the
    connectivity. ``-1`` for a pole no wire names.

    ``actor_id`` interns and ``actor_ix`` only reads. The wire pass MINTS actor indices; the
    pole pass must not, because a pole with no wire would be added to a list already
    snapshotted -- the hazard the note above the ``_pipes`` call in `extract` names.
