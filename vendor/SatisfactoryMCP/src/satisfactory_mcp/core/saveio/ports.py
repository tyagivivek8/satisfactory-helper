"""What a connector role name says about the edge it sits on.

``graph["material"]`` is one flat list holding three unrelated physical systems: conveyors
carrying items, pipes carrying fluid, and hypertubes carrying a PLAYER and nothing else.
Only the role names distinguish them, so a reader that walks the layer unfiltered treats a
hypertube as a belt -- 126 of the reference world's 11,664 edges. Every consumer of that
layer classifies here rather than keeping its own list.
