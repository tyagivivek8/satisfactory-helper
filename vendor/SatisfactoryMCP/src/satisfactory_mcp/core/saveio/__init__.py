"""The sidecar seam: reading a save file and caching what came back.

Everything above this package consumes the plain-dict projection and never learns
that a save parser, a subprocess or a pickle cache exists. That is what lets the
whole test suite run from a committed JSON fixture with no game install. It was
``satisfactory_mcp.save.projection``; that name is gone rather than aliased.
