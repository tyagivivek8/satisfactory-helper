#: Extraction rate multiplier by node purity. Not in Docs.json, but proven by it: every

#: Shards a building needs slotted to be *allowed* to run at ``clock`` -- a lower bound on

#: Fluids cannot be sunk or discarded, so a fluid byproduct must be consumed exactly. This
#: CONTRADICTS Docs.json, which gives Heavy Oil Residue 30 sink points and

#: packaged into a solid first. Confirmed by the player.

#: Capabilities the game gates behind MAM research, and the schematic that grants each. A

#: Head lift a fluid buffer needs to push out as fast as it takes in, in metres. A buffer's
#: own head lift is the height of the fluid standing in it, so this converts to a level
#: through the class's capacity and height -- both of which Docs.json does state. [WIKI]:
#: the FICSIT Plumbing Manual; nothing in the dump carries it. See `docs/plumbing.md`.
BUFFER_BALANCE_HEAD_M: float = 1.5

#: Fill fraction at and above which a buffer passes INCOMING head lift on unchanged. Below it
#: the line above a buffer gets only the buffer's own fill-proportional head, and this is a
#: step rather than a blend -- a blend is excluded arithmetically by 11 m. [MEASURED], see
#: `docs/fluids_model.md`. The bracket below is 0.7 points wide and CONTAINS this value, so
#: capacity is where the step was measured rather than a conservative reading of a wide
#: bracket. Spelled ``>=`` and never an equality: the game overfills, every reading measured
#: transmitting is strictly above 1.0 and the highest measured not transmitting is 0.99903.
BUFFER_TRANSMITS_ABOVE_FILL: float = 1.0

#: The two fills the step was measured between: off at the first, on at the second. A buffer
#: inside this band is decided by the constant above rather than by a measurement, and
#: ``HeadLift.undecided_buffers`` counts how many the verdict rested on.
BUFFER_TRANSMIT_BRACKET: tuple[float, float] = (0.99903, 1.00604)

#: Head lift any machine that is not a pipeline pump gives, in metres. [WIKI]: the FICSIT
#: Plumbing Manual -- head lift outside a pump lives in the ``FluidBox`` struct, which
#: Docs.json exports empty, so ``mDesignPressure`` exists on the pump class and on no other
#: of 2,868. See `docs/plumbing.md` §24.2.
MACHINE_HEAD_LIFT_M: float = 10.0

#: The height at which that flow drops to zero. [MEASURED], not read and not the rating times
#: a tolerance: a capped dead-end column off a Water Extractor settled 11.020 m +-0.26 above
#: its pipe connection (`docs/fluids_model.md`). "12 m", which this was, appears in none of
#: the dump's 2,868 classes. SCOPE: the dump states the same 10 m rating for six classes, and
#: an Oil Refinery on a different fluid measured 11.087 -- 67 mm away, inside the bar -- so
#: one number for all six rests on two classes and two fluids rather than on one of each.
MACHINE_MAX_HEAD_LIFT_M: float = 11.020

#: How high a pump's fluid actually stands above its centre, per BUILD class, where that has
#: been measured. NOT a correction to the dump: ``mMaxPressure`` stays what the game DECLARES
#: and keeps being what `list_buildings` reports, while this is what the game was observed to
#: DO, and the two differ -- a Mk1 reaches 0.80 m past its own declared 22 m ceiling
#: (`docs/fluids_model.md`).
#:
#: Per class because no single multiplier fits: the machine sits at x1.102 of its rating and
#: the Mk1 at x1.140 of its. A class absent here is NOT extrapolated -- the Mk2 measured
#: 55.564 against its declared 55 and is still left out, because both pump readings are
#: quantised by the 4 m pieces they were taken on and a finer rig puts the Mk1 nearer 23.0
#: (`docs/fluids_model.md`). Understating a reach only reports a climb as harder than it is.

#: Water Extractors the planner assumes can be sited, when the caller does not say.
#:
#: The only number here with no data behind it, and DANGEROUS to read as capacity. Water is
#: drawn from FGWaterVolume objects -- ocean, lakes -- which carry no node entry, no purity
#: and no geometry, so this exists only to keep the column bounded. It is NOT too high to
#: bind: a whole-map ``max_mw`` takes every one of the 200 and wants 246. Terrain does not
#: fix that -- submerged area is not an extractor count, since shoreline geometry, clearance
#: and overlap are level data nothing here reads -- so the number stays an assumption and
#: every plan that pumps says so, says whether it is binding, and quotes what was measured
#: at its site. Pass ``water_extractors`` to replace it with a number the player measured.
WATER_EXTRACTOR_CAP_ASSUMED: int = 200

#: Above this many extractors in one plan, say plainly that the count is an assumption and
