"""Machine footprints, derived from mClearanceData.

Every buildable carries `mClearanceData`, a list of boxes describing the space it occupies,
and **the boxes can be rotated**: the Fuel-Powered Generator's clearance is thin boxes at
45-degree increments approximating a round machine, so the largest one alone reads 22 x 4 m
where the real footprint is 22 x 22. Every box is therefore transformed by its
`RelativeTransform` and the union taken.

Which boxes count is the other rule. `ExcludeForSnapping` boxes are approach clearances and
never the building's own volume. `CT_Soft` boxes are skipped only while a hard box exists --
on a machine they are the overlap allowances around the hard volume -- but every architecture
piece (foundation, wall, pillar, ramp, beam) carries ONLY soft boxes, so a buildable with no
hard box falls back to the union of its soft ones rather than reporting no size at all.
