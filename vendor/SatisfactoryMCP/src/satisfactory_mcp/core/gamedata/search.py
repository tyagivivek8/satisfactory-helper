"""Recipe search, including the reverse direction: what CONSUMES an item.

Completeness is the point, and it costs two rules. The census is counted over every recipe in
Docs.json and never over the page -- ``kind``, ``include_events``, ``limit`` and ``offset``
decide what is SHOWN and never move the header's counts -- and building recipes are counted
even where they are not shown, because the build gun consumes items exactly as a Refinery does
(Rubber has 15 part consumers, 7 building and 4 manual).

The units across kinds are not comparable. Only part recipes run in a machine, so only they
have a per-minute rate; a building recipe's ``mManufactoringDuration`` is 1.0 for all 547 of
them, which would make The HUB eat 1,200 Iron Ore/min. Building and manual rows carry the
per-craft amount and are suffixed ``/build`` and ``/craft`` so no row reads as a throughput.
