"""Replace a file's contents, or leave the file exactly as it was.

``Path.write_text`` truncates first and writes second, so a crash inside that window leaves a
truncated file and a concurrent reader gets a prefix of one; ``os.replace`` closes it. On
Windows the replace can also FAIL with ``PermissionError`` while another process holds the
destination open, having changed nothing -- so a caller treats that as "not written this
time" rather than as loss.
