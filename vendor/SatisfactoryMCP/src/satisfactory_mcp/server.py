"""FastMCP entry point.

Nothing is defined here. The app object and the shared resolvers live in
``interfaces.mcp.app``, and every tool, resource and prompt lives in
``interfaces/mcp/tools/``, one module per concern. Importing ``tools`` is what
registers them -- the decorators run on import.

The file stays at this path whatever moves beneath it: the console script is
``satisfactory_mcp.server:main``.

This file was 3,467 lines with 36 tools in it before the split. The names below are
re-exported because tests and ad-hoc scripts reach for ``server.plan_factory`` and
friends, and because a caller should not have to know which module a tool ended up in.

Every tool passes ``structured_output=False``: a tool annotated ``-> str`` otherwise
gets an outputSchema AND has its whole payload echoed into ``structuredContent``, a
measured ~1.96x wire-size tax for no benefit.
