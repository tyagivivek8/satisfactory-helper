"""The inflated body: preamble, world-partition grids, levels and object headers.

This layer sits between ``chunks.decompress_body`` and the property serialiser, and answers
one question -- *where is every object's property blob* -- by walking, never by searching.
Every region declares its own length and the walk asserts that each declared length lands
exactly where the next structure begins, so a save torn mid-write fails on the first size that
does not add up instead of yielding a shorter factory. Which fields are present is gated on
``save_version``; see ``versions.py`` for the thresholds.

The body, at saveVersion 52 and above::

    i64  body size                 len(body) - 8, self-describing
    59B  archive version header    saveVersion 60 only -- see ARCHIVE_HEADER_LEN
    i32  custom version count      60 only; then that many (16-byte GUID, i32 version)
    i32  grid count                then that many world-partition grids
    i32  sub-level count
    ...  sub-level records         each named after a partition cell
    ...  the persistent level      the SAME record, with NO name string
    ...  a destroyed-actor table keyed by level name, closing the body

One level record. The two blocks are parallel lists, ``header[i]`` describing ``object[i]``,
and they are NOT interleaved::

    str  name                      (absent on the persistent level)
    i64  toc size ; [ i32 header count ][ headers ][ destroyed-actor list ]
    i64  data size ; [ i32 object count ][ object entries ]
    i32  version (52 or 60)        \\
    i32  destroyed count ; refs     |  the trailer, absent on the persistent level
    i32  archive-follows flag      /

Below saveVersion 30 there is no level list at all: one flat run of headers, then one run of
entries, then a bare destroyed-actor list closing the body. Every size field is an int32 below
saveVersion 52 and an int64 at and above it.

An object's serialisation version is per object rather than per save -- an untouched
world-partition cell keeps the bytes it was written with, so 36, 52 and 60 all appear in one
file. A version-60 payload carries one extra byte immediately before its property list (after
the reference lists on an actor, at the very start on a component); it is inside the slice, so
``properties.py`` reads it.
