"""The class-specific bytes trailing an actor's property list, for seven of the eight classes
that have them; ``FGLightweightBuildableSubsystem``, the eighth, has its own module.

Every reader here is checked by exact consumption: a record read correctly ends precisely
where the object declared its trailing bytes end, and any wrong field width leaves a
remainder. Fields that stay unexplained are named ``unknown`` rather than given a plausible
name. Decoding is lazy -- ``ParsedObject.actorSpecificInfo`` decodes on first access -- so a
malformed trailer raises inside the caller rather than at the save boundary.

    ``segments[0]`` and ``segments[-1]``.

    are the DOWNSTREAM end, which reads backwards from their names. The last segment starts at
    0 at the chain's INPUT and the first segment's end is the OUTPUT.

    **An offset is not confined to ``[0, length]`` and a consumer must clamp both ends.** One
    item per chain may sit above the length -- the one at ring index ``first``, by up to a few
    centimetres, scaling with belt speed -- and items sit below 0, down to about -1,000 cm, when
    the contiguous pack is longer than 120 cm spacing allows.
