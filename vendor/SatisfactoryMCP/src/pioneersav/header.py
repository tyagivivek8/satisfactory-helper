"""The uncompressed header at the front of a .sav file.

It is read straight off the front with no decompression, which is why ``read_info`` is cheap
enough to call on every save in a directory just to group them by world. It is a linear
sequence with no lengths or offsets to seek by, so a field added by a future patch shifts
everything after it and the ``PACKAGE_FILE_TAG`` check at the end of the walk is what catches
that. The old header is a strict prefix of the modern one -- types 8 and 9 have an identical
field list, 10 adds ``save_identifier``, 14 adds ``save_name``, two unnamed int32s,
``save_data_hash`` and ``is_creative`` -- so this is one walk with gated fields rather than
four layouts. Absent fields read as ``None`` rather than ``0``/``False``, because a zero says
"not creative" and ``None`` says "this header has no such field".
