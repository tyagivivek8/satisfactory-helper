"""Where the format changed, as named thresholds rather than magic numbers.

Six ``saveVersion``s are one format with fields added, so every layer reads one walk with
version-gated fields and these constants are the gates. **A threshold is where a change was
observed, not where the game made it**: no save exists between saveVersion 36 and 51, so
every difference in that gap arrives at one constant and none of them can be attributed to a
particular patch. "Header ends at" below is the offset of ``header.PACKAGE_FILE_TAG``, which
is the referee for the header layout -- a candidate field list is right when the walk lands
exactly there.

| saveHeaderType | saveVersion | header ends at | body shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 25 | 146 | no level list |
| 9 | 28 | 159 | no level list |
| 10 | 30, 36 | 186 | named levels, int32 sizes |
| 14 | 52 | 283 or 297 | grid table, int64 sizes |
| 14 | 60 | 450, 453 or 457 | + archive version header |

#: The saveVersion at and above which the body has all of the following. They change together
#: because no save exists between 36 and 51 to separate them:
#:
#: * the body's own size and every level's two block sizes widen from **int32 to int64**;
#: * a **world-partition grid table** appears before the level list;
#: * an object **header** gains its ``EObjectFlags`` word;
#: * an object **entry** gains a leading version int32 and a flag int32, so below this the
#:   entry is a bare size and the object's version is not in the bytes at all -- it has to be
#:   taken from the save;
#: * a level **trailer** gains its leading version int32;
#: * the persistent level's destroyed-actor list becomes **grouped by partition cell**;
#: * ``FVector``, ``FQuat`` and ``FBox`` are written as **float32** below this and float64 at
#:   and above it, and ``FInventoryItem`` is two object references below it.
