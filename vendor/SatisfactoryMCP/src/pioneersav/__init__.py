"""A parser for Satisfactory .sav files, covering what this project reads.

The scope is the parts the projection uses, which is three entry points' worth:
``read_info`` for the header, ``read_body`` for the object walk, ``read_full_save`` for both
plus decoded properties. Anything it does not understand is skipped by its declared length
rather than guessed at, so an unknown property costs that property and not the save.
