"""Decompressing the body, which the game writes as a run of zlib chunks.

Everything after the header is a sequence of independently-compressed blocks, each with a
49-byte preamble; concatenating the inflated blocks gives the one flat byte stream the level
and object walk reads. The sizes are written twice and the first copy is verified against the
second, which is the only integrity check this format offers. The tag is checked per chunk
rather than once, so a save torn mid-write fails on the chunk holding the tear instead of
inflating garbage into the object walk::

    int64  tag                 0x222222229E2A83C1
    int64  max chunk size      131072 on every save seen
    uint8  compressor          3
    int64  compressed size     \\
    int64  uncompressed size    | written twice, identically
    int64  compressed size      |
    int64  uncompressed size   /

A pre-1.0 save (saveVersion 25 to 36) writes a 48-byte preamble: the same fields without the
compressor byte, and with the tag's high half zero, so its tag is ``0x9E2A83C1``.
