"""One call that reads a whole .sav, composing the four layers below into the shape the
projection consumes: ``save.levels[i].actorAndComponentObjectHeaders`` parallel to
``save.levels[i].objects``, each object carrying ``properties`` as ``[name, value]`` pairs.

**The body has to stay alive for the whole parse**, because every ``ObjectSlice`` and every
``ParsedObject.extra_offset`` is an absolute index into it and nothing is copied. This module
is also where an actor's class is matched to a trailing-bytes reader, which
``ParsedObject.actorSpecificInfo`` calls on first access rather than during the parse, since
decoding every conveyor chain costs a fifth again of the parse for data no projection field
reads.
